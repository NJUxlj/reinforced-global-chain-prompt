{"question": "Q: t A: ", "rationale": "To determine how many reasons the author thinks human cloning is wrong, let's analyze the article for the explicit reasons given:\n1. **Identity Issues**: The author argues that cloning could prevent individuals from having their own personal identities by giving them someone else's genetic identity. This is stated as a concern about people's right to their unique identities.\n2. **Power Struggle**: Cloning allows a degree of power and control over another person's physical identity, potentially leading to an imbalance where the person cloning has more authority than a parent, infringing on personal rights.\n3. **Embryo Risks**: The author mentions the high failure rate in cloning processes, as evidenced by Dolly the sheep, where only one embryo survived out of over 200. This point raises ethical concerns about the high rate of embryo loss and destruction.\n4. **Danger to Mother and Clone**: There are risks involved with cloning concerning the safety of both the birth mother and the clone, citing studies on cows where a significant percentage of birth mothers died, indicating a high-risk factor.\nGiven this breakdown, the author indeed provides four main reasons why human cloning is considered wrong. \nTherefore, the answer is 'A. 4'.", "pred_ans": "A", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 2. **Club Saturday Swim**: This program is held each Saturday afternoon from 12:00-12:30 pm or 12:30-1:00 pm. This means it is available on Saturdays. 3. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13)**: This program is held on Wednesdays from 4:00-5:00 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: t A:  Let's think step by step."}
{"question": "Q: e A: ", "rationale": "To determine how many main reasons the author thinks human cloning is wrong, we should look at the arguments provided in the text:\n1. **Identity Issues**: The author argues that cloning could infringe on a person's right to their own genetic identity and personality, as it gives them someone else's genetic identity.\n2. **Power Struggle**: Cloning creates a power dynamic where the person doing the cloning has disproportionate control over the clone's physical identity, which could violate their autonomy.\n3. **Embryo Loss and Ethical Concerns**: The example of Dolly the sheep, where only one out of over 200 embryos survived, highlights the high failure rate and potential ethical issues concerning the destruction of embryos.\n4. **Risks to Clone and Birth Mother**: There are significant health risks to both the clone and the birth mother, as evidenced in studies with high failure rates and deaths of birth mothers in cow studies.\nThe author explicitly states these four main reasons throughout the text as grounds for opposing human cloning.

The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: e A:  Let's think step by step."}
{"question": "Q: o A: ", "rationale": "To determine how many reasons the author thinks human cloning is wrong, we need to carefully consider the arguments presented in the passage.\n1. **Identity Issues**: The author discusses how cloning could infringe upon a person's right to their own personality and genetic identity.\n2. **Power Struggle**: Cloning represents a degree of control over another individual's physical identity, giving the cloner excessive power.\n3. **Embryo Loss**: The high failure rate of cloning processes, exemplified by the case of Dolly the sheep, suggests a significant ethical concern regarding embryo viability.\n4. **Risks and Dangers**: The potential dangers to both the clone and the birth mother are highlighted, including high failure rates and mortality risks in animal studies.\nThe author explicitly states there are four main reasons for opposing human cloning. Thus, the answer is:\n- **A. 4**\nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.", "pred_ans": "A", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it.

And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model.

However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: o A:  Let's think step by step."}
{"question": "Q: h A: ", "rationale": "To determine how many reasons the author thinks human cloning is wrong, let's review the reasons mentioned in the article:\n1. **Identity Issues**: The article mentions that cloning could interfere with a person's right to their own identity and personality by giving them someone else's genetic identity.\n2. **Power Struggle**: The article points out that cloning involves a degree of control over another person's physical identity, giving the person performing the cloning more power than any parent would have, and ignoring the rights of the cloned individual.\n3. **Killing Embryos**: The article discusses the ethical concern surrounding the destruction of embryos during the cloning process. The example of Dolly the sheep highlights that a large number of embryos were destroyed or failed during the attempt.\n4. **Risk to Birth Mother and Clone**: The article mentions that cloning is dangerous for both the birth mother and the clone, as evidenced by studies on cows where a significant number of birth mothers died, and a high failure rate was observed.\nThe author clearly enumerates four main reasons why human cloning is considered wrong. Each point is distinct and covers different ethical, scientific, and moral issues.\nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A. 4.", "pred_ans": "A", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations.

To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: h A:  Let's think step by step."}
{"question": "Q: m A: ", "rationale": "To determine the correct answer, we need to refer back to the text and count the number of reasons the author gives for why human cloning is wrong. Let's list and evaluate each one mentioned:\n1. **Identity Issues**: The author expresses concern that cloning could infringe on a person's right to their own personality by giving them someone else's genetic identity.\n2. **Power Struggle**: Cloning involves a power dynamic where the person doing the cloning has control over the clone's physical identity, which can violate their rights.\n3. **Embryo Loss and Ethical Concerns**: The process involves killing many embryos. The experiment with Dolly the sheep resulted in a large number of embryo losses, raising concerns about the ethics of wasting potential lives.\n4. **Health Risks to Mother and Clone**: Cloning is deemed extremely dangerous for both the clone and the surrogate mother, as evidenced by high failure rates in animal experiments.\nThe author specifically states that these are four reasons against human cloning. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n- **A. 4** \nThis corresponds with the information provided in the passage, where the author clearly outlines four main objections to human cloning.", "pred_ans": "A", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province.

To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B.

Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly.

The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: m A:  Let's think step by step."}
{"question": "Q: a A: ", "rationale": "Certainly! Let's consider why the author thinks human cloning is wrong:\n1. **Identity Issues**: The author argues that cloning could lead to problems related to personal identity, as every human has the right to their own personality. Cloning could potentially violate this right by giving individuals someone else's genetic identity.\n2. **Power Struggle**: The author expresses concern about the degree of power and control cloning gives over another person's physical identity. This could lead to a situation where the person doing the cloning has unprecedented control over the clone, more so than a parent would over their child, which is seen as a violation of personal rights.\n3. **Embryo Loss**: The process of cloning is characterized by a high failure rate, as shown in the document by the example of Dolly the sheep, where many embryos were wasted. Applying this process to humans, the author worries, would result in the loss of numerous human embryos.\n4. **Dangers and Risks**: Cloning is presented as dangerous to both the birth mother and the clone. The high failure rates seen in animal experiments, where a significant number of birth mothers died, suggest a similar risk could occur in humans.\nGiven these points, the author lists four main reasons why human cloning is considered wrong. Therefore, the correct option is:\n**A. 4**", "pred_ans": "A", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

To determine which program you can attend on a Saturday, we need to look at the schedules provided for each program in the article. 1. **Friends and Buddies**: This program is held on 2 Fridays per month. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 2. **Club Saturday Swim**: This program is held each Saturday afternoon from 12:00-12:30 pm or 12:30-1:00 pm. This means it is available on Saturdays. 3. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13)**: This program is held on Wednesdays from 4:00-5:00 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning.

The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ:   A:  Let's think step by step."}

The article explicitly states that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons, which can be summarized as follows:\n1. **Identity Issues**: The author argues that cloning disregards the right of individuals to their own identities by giving them someone else's genetic identity.\n2. **Power and Control**: Cloning is said to create a power imbalance, where the person doing the cloning has excessive control over another individual's physical identity, infringing on their rights.\n3. **Moral and Biological Risks**: The author highlights the high failure rate in cloning attempts, as seen with Dolly the sheep, where many embryos died or were discarded. This point also underscores the ethical concerns of \"killing embryos\" during the process.\n4. **Health Risks**: Cloning is described as being dangerous to both the clone and the birth mother, citing studies on cows where a significant number of birth mothers died.\nEach of these four points constitutes a distinct argument against cloning.

The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall.

Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: s A:  Let's think step by step."}
