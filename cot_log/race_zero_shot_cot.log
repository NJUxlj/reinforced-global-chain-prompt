Q: article:
            Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out.
"Surgery ," one replied.
I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .
One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!"
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.
            question:
            We can know from the passage that the author works as a_.
            options:
            ['A. doctor', 'B. model', 'C. teacher', 'D. reporter']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the author's profession, let's analyze the information given in the passage:1.

            ['A. everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost', "B. it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs", "C. it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career", 'D. media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the author's belief according to the passage, we need to carefully analyze the text and connect the author's opinions with the given options. 1. The author expresses concern about students undergoing surgery to gain an advantage in the job market, suggesting that the author does not support the idea of undergoing physical changes for career advancement.2. The passage discusses societal pressure for physical "perfection" due to media portrayals, such as magazines, TV shows, movies, and advertisements. The author seems critical of this portrayal and implies that it is unrealistic.3. Towards the end, the author clearly states: "In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career." This suggests the author values skills over appearance.Now let's examine the options:- A. everyone should purchase perfection, whatever the cost: This contradicts the author's view, as the author does not advocate purchasing "perfection" and criticizes the pressure to conform to unrealistic standards.- B. it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs: While the author initially considers that graduates might seek help from mentors or family friends, this is not the main point of their argument. The emphasis is on surgery and cosmetic changes, making The answer is option D: media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery. The author criticizes the media for promoting unrealistic ideals of "perfection"

Q: article:
            YUZHOU, HENAN -An accident in a central China coal mine killed 21 miners Saturday and left another 16 trapped underground , the government said.
The death
rose to 26 Sunday morning as rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners who were still trapped underground, rescue headquarters said.
Rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners still trapped underground, but chances for them to survive were very slim, said Du Bo, deputy chief of the rescue headquarters.
"Based upon past experience, the remaining 11 miners could be buried in coal dust, so the survival chances are frail," Du said.
More than 2,500 tons of coal dust smothered  the pit after the gas leak , which hampered  the rescue, said Du.
The gas outburst happened at 6:03 a.m. Saturday when 276 miners were working underground in the mine in Yuzhou City. A total of 239 workers escaped but 21 were found dead and 16 trapped.
An initial  investigation showed that 173,500 cubic meters of gas leaked out in the accident. Liu Wenbin, a deputy chief engineer of the company that owns the mine, was in the pit  when the accident happened. He organized the escape.
"At around 6 a.m., I felt there was something wrong with the airflow in the shaft, and one of the team captains told me he also felt it and had already reported the problem," said Liu
The mine is owned by Pingyu Coal & Electric Co. Ltd., a company jointly established by four investors, including Zhong Ping Energy Chemical Group and China Power Investment Corp.
            question:
            What could be the best title for this passage?
            options:
            ['A. Death Toll Rises in an Accident in China', 'B. A Coal Mine Accident in Central China', 'C. An Accident in Central China', 'D. Coal Mine Accidents in China']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the best title for the passage, we need to capture the main focus or theme of the event described. Here are the steps to consider each option:1. Analyze the Content:    - The passage discusses a specific coal mine accident in Yuzhou, Henan, China. Details include the number of miners killed, trapped, and the challenges faced in the rescue operation.2. Evaluate the Options:   - Option A: "Death Toll Rises in an Accident in China"     - This option highlights the increasing death toll, which is relevant since the passage points out the rise from 21 to 26 deaths. However, it doesn’t specify the nature of the accident, which is important context.      - Option B: "A Coal Mine Accident in Central China"     - This option accurately specifies it is a coal mine accident in central China, which is very much the core of the passage.      - Option C: "An Accident in Central China"     - This title is very vague. While it captures the event location, it fails to mention it’s a coal mine accident, making it less informative.      - Option D: "Coal Mine Accidents in China"     - This implies a broader retrospective look at various accidents rather The answer is 'B. A Coal Mine Accident in Central China'

Until the next morning another 5 miners were found dead in this accident']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer the question, we need to analyze the information given in the passage step by step:1. The accident occurred in a coal mine in Yuzhou, Henan, China. Initially, 276 miners were working underground.2. After the gas outburst, 239 miners escaped successfully.3. Initially, it was reported that 21 miners were found dead.4. By Sunday morning (the next morning), the death toll rose to 26, indicating an additional 5 miners were found dead.5. There were still 11 miners trapped underground, and their survival chances were described as very slim due to being possibly buried in coal dust.Let's evaluate the options based on the above information:- Option A: "Of the 276 miners in the mine, only 21 were dead until the next morning." This option is incorrect because, by the next morning, 26 miners were confirmed dead.- Option B: "The miners trapped underground would be saved without difficulty." This is incorrect because the passage indicates that the survival chances for the trapped miners were very slim.- Option C: "16 miners trapped underground were still found alive waiting for the rescue." This is incorrect according to the passage. While 16 miners were initially trapped and efforts were ongoing The answer is Option D: "Until the next morning another 5 miners were found dead in this accident." This conclusion is based on the information that the death toll increased from

Q: article:
            Understanding the process of making career choices and managing your career is a basic life skill that everyone should understand.
Your career decisions have such a profound effect on all aspects of your life. It's important to have the knowledge and resources needed to make smart, informed decisions. Whether you are looking for a new job, aiming to take the next step at your current job or planning your retirement options, you are making career decisions. Using good resources and the guidance of a career counselor can help you to make those decisions well.
Many people mistakenly believe that choosing a career is a one-time event that happens some time in early adulthood. However, career management is actually a life-long process, and we continue to make consequential   career choices over the years. When people want to take action in their career, career management and job search are about so much more than writing a good resume. If you learn about and act on the following areas of career management, you'll be rewarded throughout your career.
Your interests, abilities, values, personal needs and realities should all be taken into account in any career decision making process. You spend countless hours at work, and it impacts your life in so many ways; it makes sense that you should be fully informed before making such profound decisions.
Do you know how many different career choices are available to you? Both The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (American) and The National Occupational Classification (Canadian) list well over 20,000 different job titles. So unless you've actively explored a variety of career options, there's a very good chance that there are great possibilities available to you, and you don't even realize they exist.
Match your understanding of yourself with your understanding of possible career options. Once you have developed a good understanding of yourself, you will be able to combine that self-knowledge with your career and labor market research to determine potential careers that are a great fit for you.
When you've made a well informed decision, then you're ready to make it happen. Making use of good career guidance and resources will help you to acquire the education, skills, and experience needed to get the job and learn and implement   effective job search strategies.
Time spent understanding your needs, researching your career options and developing outstanding job search skills, guided by great career resources, is a powerful investment in your future.

            options:
            ["A. career decision is misunderstood by many people because they don't take it as a life-long process", 'B. your career will be definitely successful if you make a well informed decision', 'C. making yourself understood can help you make a final choice', 'D. writing a good resume can find a good job']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To address this question, we need to analyze the content of the article and match it with the given options. 1. **Understanding Career Decisions as a Life-long Process**: The text discusses the misconception that choosing a career is a one-time event, emphasizing that career management is actually a life-long process. This aligns closely with option A, suggesting that career decisions are misunderstood because people don't view them as ongoing processes.2. **Success from Well-Informed Decisions**: While the article notes the importance of making well-informed career decisions, it doesn't guarantee definite success solely based on informed decisions. This makes option B less accurate, as it implies a certainty that isn't supported by the text.3. **Making Yourself Understood**: The article does not specifically mention "making yourself understood" as a factor in career decision-making, so option C seems unrelated to the text.4. **Importance of a Good Resume**: The article implies that while a good resume is part of the process, career management involves much more than just writing a resume. Therefore, option D oversimplifies the process and does not fully capture the article's emphasis on comprehensive career management.Given these considerations, the most fitting inference is:**A. career decision is misunderstood by many people because they don't The answer is "A. career decision is misunderstood by many people because they don't take it as a life-long process."

Q: article:
            Astronauts on shorter shuttle missions often work very long days.  Tasks are scheduled so tightly that break times are often used to finish the day's work.  This type of schedule is far too demanding for long missions on the International  Space Station(ISS). ISS crewmembers usually live in space for at least a quarter of a year. They work five days on and two days off to _ the normal way they do things on Earth as much as possible. Weekends give the crew valuable time to rest and do a few hours of housework. They can communicate with family and friends by email , internet phone and through private video conferences.
While astronauts cannot go to a baseball game or a movie in orbit, there are many familiar activities that they can still enjoy . Before a mission, the family and friends of each ISS crewmember put together a collection of family photos, messages, videos and reading material for the astronauts to look at when they will be floating 370 kilometers above the Earth. During their mission, the crew also receives care packages with CDs, books, magazines, photos and letters . And as from early 2010, the internet became available on the ISS , giving astronauts the chance to do some "web surfing "in their personal time. Besides relaxing with these more common entertainments, astronauts can simply enjoy the experience of living in space.
Many astronauts say that one of the most relaxing things to do in space is to look out the window and stare at the universe and the Earth's vast land mass and oceans.
            question:
            Which of the following best describes the families of the astronauts on the ISS ?
            options:
            ['A. They are caring and thoughtful.', 'B. They are worried and upset.', 'C. They are impatient and annoyed.', 'D. They are excited and curious.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine which option best describes the families of the astronauts on the ISS, let's closely examine the relevant portion of the provided text:The article states, "Before a mission, the family and friends of each ISS crewmember put together a collection of family photos, messages, videos and reading material for the astronauts to look at when they will be floating 370 kilometers above the Earth." This indicates that the families and friends take the time and effort to gather meaningful and personal items that the astronauts can enjoy during their mission. This shows a level of care and thoughtfulness on the part of the families, as they are ensuring that the astronauts have personal and comforting items available to them while they are away from home.Given this information, let's evaluate the options:- **A. They are caring and thoughtful.** This option aligns with the actions of the families, as they prepare thoughtful care packages and personal collections for the astronauts.- **B. They are worried and upset.** There is no textual evidence to suggest that the families are worried or upset. Instead, the focus is on the supportive actions they take.- **C. They are impatient and annoyed.** This is not supported by the text; the families are actively involved in supporting the astronauts, which suggests patience rather The answer is A. They are caring and thoughtful.

            Dogs have long been used to find explosives and drugs.Now,a new study shows that man's best friend can also help to find lung and breast cancer,researchers report in integrative Cancer Therapies.The findings show that trained ordinary household dogs can detect early--stage lung and breast cancers by smelling the breath samples of patients.
Researchers have found that cancer cells send out molecules different from those of healthy ones,and that might be sensed by smell by the highly sensitive dog's nose.
For the study,five dogs were trained by a professional instructor to respond differently to breath samples of healthy and cancer patients."The dogs learned to sit or lie down in front of cancer patient samples and to ignore control samples through the method of food reward," McCulloch explained.
After a period of training,researchers tested the animals'ability to distinguish cancer patients from controls.The animals were given breath samples from 55 patients with lung cancer,3 1 with breast cancer and 83 healthy controls who were not included in the original training period.
McCulloch's group found that the dogs were able to correctly distinguish the breath samples of cancer patients from those of the control subjects in about 90 percent of the cases.The dogs were also able to detecting early-stage lung and breast cancers.
"These results show that there is hope for early detection,"McCulloch said.The re-searches are planning to conduct further studies on the breath composition of cancer patients to possibly design an electronic device that can do the dogs'job."A dog's nose is so powerful it can detect odors 10 000 to 100 000 times better than a human nose can.I hope people will be interested in doing this research,"McCulloch added,"It shows that there is definitely something out there."

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the correct answer, we need to find the details from the article about the number of dogs and people involved in McCulloch's research.1. **Number of Dogs**:    The article mentions, "For the study, five dogs were trained by a professional instructor...". This indicates that 5 dogs were used in the research.2. **Number of People (samples)**:    The breath samples taken during the study were from:   - 55 patients with lung cancer   - 31 patients with breast cancer   - 83 healthy controls   Adding these together gives: 55 (lung cancer) + 31 (breast cancer) + 83 (healthy controls) = 169 people from whom breath samples were collected for the study.3. **Selection from Options**:   Let's examine the provided options:   - A. 10 dogs and 55 people   - B. 5 dogs and 86 people   - C. 10 dogs and 83 people   - D. 5 dogs and 169 peopleGiven our findings:- We identified that 5 dogs were used. - Breath samples were collected from a total of 169 people.Therefore, the correct option The answer is 'D. 5 dogs and 169 people'

            We can infer from the passage that_.
            options:
            ['A. dogs can smell signs of other cancers except the above two kinds', 'B. the final goal of the researchers is to design an electronic dog to detect cancer', 'C. dogs can detect odors 10 000 to 100 000 times better than humans can', 'D. dogs will soon be widely used to smell signs of cancers in hospitals']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To infer the correct answer from the passage, let's evaluate each option and the relevant information given in the passage:1. **A. dogs can smell signs of other cancers except the above two kinds**: The passage specifically mentions that dogs can detect early-stage lung and breast cancers, but it doesn't provide information about their ability to detect other types of cancer. So this option cannot be inferred from the passage.2. **B. the final goal of the researchers is to design an electronic dog to detect cancer**: The passage mentions that researchers plan to study the breath composition of cancer patients to potentially design an electronic device that can do the dogs' job. This suggests that designing an electronic device to detect cancer is indeed their goal. Therefore, this option is a possibility that can be inferred.3. **C. dogs can detect odors 10 000 to 100 000 times better than humans can**: The passage explicitly states this information, so it's not an inference but a fact mentioned directly.4. **D. dogs will soon be widely used to smell signs of cancers in hospitals**: While the study's results are promising, the passage does not suggest that there are plans to implement the use of dogs in hospitals widely. It focuses more on the potential development of The answer is B. the final goal of the researchers is to design an electronic dog to detect cancer.

Q: article:
            Every time I lost a tooth I would put it under my pillow at night. The next morning I would wake up to find two coins replacing my tooth. Then I'd wonder about the tooth fairy all day.
"Mom, where do you think the tooth fairy lives? What does she do with the teeth she collects?"
My mom said she didn't know. She only knew that the tooth fairy took the tooth away while we were sleeping and left us some money under our pillow. But I wanted to find out. So I think it was a good thing that I would lose another tooth. The plan was to stay up all night and ask the tooth fairy when she showed up.
That night I lay quietly in my bed, growing sleepy as the night went on. Moments later, I felt that someone was close to me. Through my half-opened eyes, I didn't see any feet, but I knew it was the tooth fairy. I watched her run around and fly right out of my room. She was wearing a shiny green dress. After she left, I immediately felt under my pillow. There were two coins. I had never even felt my pillow move. I wondered if she used magic.
As I got older, I learned from my teachers that the tooth fairy didn't exist. It was just a mythical figure of early childhood. I kind of thought it was, but how could I see the tooth fairy fly that night?
Then one night my mom came into my room to check on me. The moonlight was bright that night and it shone through my window right on her shiny green nightdress. Right then I knew deep down that my mom was the tooth fairy.
            question:
            As a young girl, the author   _  .
            options:
            ['A. was afraid of the tooth fairy', 'B. was interested in the tooth fairy', 'C. knew where the tooth fairy lived', 'D. doubted if the tooth fairy existed']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the details provided in the article about the author's feelings and thoughts regarding the tooth fairy.1. The article describes how the author had an active interest in the tooth fairy, asking her mother questions like, "Where do you think the tooth fairy lives? What does she do with the teeth she collects?"2. The author was curious enough to devise a plan to stay up all night to directly ask the tooth fairy these questions when she appeared.3. The author's wonder and curiosity continued even when she grew older as she learned from her teachers that the tooth fairy didn't exist. Despite this, she recalled an experience from her childhood where she felt she had seen the tooth fairy.4. The turning point came when the author realized that her mother, in a shiny green nightdress, was actually the one acting as the tooth fairy.Based on this information, we can eliminate the options as follows:- Option A, "was afraid of the tooth fairy," is incorrect. There's no indication in the article that the author was afraid. Instead, she seemed curious and intrigued.- Option C, "knew where the tooth fairy lived," is incorrect. The article explicitly says the author asked her mother where the tooth fairy lived.- Option The answer is B, "was interested in the tooth fairy," is correct. The author's actions and questions show that she was quite curious and interested in the tooth fairy, trying

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the relevant parts of the article and the options provided.1. The author mentions they had a plan to stay up all night to ask the tooth fairy questions when she showed up. This indicates that the author was eager to see the tooth fairy again and possibly interact with her.2. The author expresses curiosity about where the tooth fairy lives and what she does with the collected teeth, suggesting a belief in the tooth fairy.3. Given these points, the reason the author thought it was a good thing to lose another tooth was primarily because they wanted the tooth fairy to visit again to satisfy their curiosity about her.Now, let's evaluate the options:- Option A: "she could get some coins" – While getting coins was a part of the experience, the emphasis in the story is on the author's curiosity about the tooth fairy.- Option B: "she disliked her baby teeth" – The story doesn't suggest any dissatisfaction with baby teeth; it focuses on the tooth fairy.- Option C: "she wanted to help her mother solve a mystery" – There is no indication in the story that the mother wanted to solve a mystery about the tooth fairy.- Option D: "she believed the tooth fairy would come again" – This aligns The answer is D: she believed the tooth fairy would come again.

Q: article:
            The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like "I never do anything right" into positive ones like "I can succeed." But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking?
Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are.
The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing   older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.
In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, "I am lovable."
Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation  . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.
The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy   that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation   techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking.
            question:
            According to the study of the Canadian researchers,   _  .
            options:
            ['A. positive thinking is not as powerful as negative thinking', 'B. encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people', "C. happy people can think positively while unhappy people can't", 'D. getting people to think positively can strengthen their confidence']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer the question, we need to refer to the findings from the Canadian researchers' study as presented in the article.1. The study indicates that trying to encourage people to think positively can sometimes have an inverse effect, particularly on those with low self-esteem.2. The article mentions that when individuals receive positive feedback they believe to be exaggerated or not genuine, they tend to feel worse.3. In the specific experiment by Wood, Lee, and Perunovic, those with low self-esteem who were prompted to think positive thoughts felt worse compared to a control group that did not receive such prompts.4. The article suggests that forcing positive thinking on individuals, particularly those already feeling down, can highlight their negativity and make them feel even less positive.Now, let's evaluate the options:- Option A: "positive thinking is not as powerful as negative thinking" - While the article discusses the drawbacks of forced positive thinking, it doesn't directly claim negative thinking is more powerful.  - Option B: "encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people" - This aligns with the study's findings; forced positive affirmations can worsen moods for some individuals, which supports this option.- Option C: "happy people can think positively while unhappy people can't" - The article doesn’t discuss The answer is Option B: "encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people" - This aligns with the study's findings; forced positive affirmations can worsen moods for some

Q: article:
            She was 6 years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live. She insisted on talking to me. "I'm building," she said.
"I see that. What is it?" I asked, not caring.
"Oh, I don't know, I just like the feel of sand."
That sounds good, I thought, and slipped off my shoes.
A sandpiper   glided by.
"My mom says sandpipers come to bring us joy."
"Good-bye joy," I muttered   to myself, "Hello pain," and turned to walk on. I was depressed; my life seemed completely out of balance.
"What's your name?" She wouldn't give up.
"Robert," I answered.
"Mine's Wendy... I'm 6. Why are you so quiet?"
I turned to her and shouted: "Because my mother died!"
"Oh," she said quietly, "then this is a bad day."
"Yes," I said, "and yesterday and the day before and - oh, go away!"
"Did it hurt?" she asked. "Did what hurt?" I was annoyed with her, with myself.
"When she died?"
"Of course it hurt!" I replied angrily, misunderstanding.
A month after that, when I next went to the beach, she wasn't there. Feeling guilty, ashamed, I went up to the cottage and knocked at the door. A young woman answered.

I took Wendy's mother in my arms. "I'm so sorry," I muttered over and over, and we wept together. But then we looked at the picture of the sandpiper and slowly both of us began to smile, remembering the lesson that Wendy had left us.

            options:
            ['A. Wendy knew she was going to die', 'B. Wendy had no friends of her age', "C. Wendy didn't believe sandpipers could bring people joy", 'D. Wendy had no experience of losing a close family member']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To solve this question, we need to analyze the interaction between the author and Wendy in the narrative.1. **Wendy's Perspective**: Wendy was a young child who seemed to have an understanding of deeper emotions and an acceptance of circumstances, perhaps because of her illness. 2. **Author's Misunderstanding**: The author, Robert, was in a state of depression due to his own loss. He was not in a place to fully comprehend or reflect on Wendy's subtle messages or the wisdom she might have had.3. **Analysis of Options**:   - **A. Wendy knew she was going to die**: When Wendy asked "Did it hurt?" it implied a unique perspective, potentially from someone who has thought about death. The author missed this understanding due to his preoccupation with his grief.   - **B. Wendy had no friends of her age**: There’s no evidence in the text to suggest this was a misunderstanding on the author’s part.   - **C. Wendy didn't believe sandpipers could bring people joy**: Wendy expressed belief that sandpipers brought joy, which was consistent with her mother's saying.   - **D. Wendy had no experience of losing a close family member**: This topic wasn't directly addressed The answer is A. Wendy knew she was going to die

            She was 6 years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live. She insisted on talking to me. "I'm building," she said.
"I see that. What is it?" I asked, not caring.
"Oh, I don't know, I just like the feel of sand."
That sounds good, I thought, and slipped off my shoes.
A sandpiper   glided by.
"My mom says sandpipers come to bring us joy."
"Good-bye joy," I muttered   to myself, "Hello pain," and turned to walk on. I was depressed; my life seemed completely out of balance.
"What's your name?" She wouldn't give up.
"Robert," I answered.
"Mine's Wendy... I'm 6. Why are you so quiet?"
I turned to her and shouted: "Because my mother died!"
"Oh," she said quietly, "then this is a bad day."
"Yes," I said, "and yesterday and the day before and - oh, go away!"
"Did it hurt?" she asked. "Did what hurt?" I was annoyed with her, with myself.
"When she died?"
"Of course it hurt!" I replied angrily, misunderstanding.
A month after that, when I next went to the beach, she wasn't there. Feeling guilty, ashamed, I went up to the cottage and knocked at the door. A young woman answered.

            options:
            ['A. know the girl had a disease', 'B. treat the girl nicely a month ago', "C. attend the girl's funeral", 'D. keep his promise to meet the girl on the beach']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine why the author felt guilty when he saw that Wendy was not on the beach, let's examine the details of the story:1. **First Encounter**: The author met Wendy on the beach, where she approached him while building with sand. Despite his own sadness, Robert engaged in a conversation with her. However, he was indifferent and dismissive, especially after she continued asking about his mother.2. **Author's Dismissive Behavior**: During this interaction, Robert expressed his frustration and grief rather harshly to Wendy. He told her to go away after she asked probing but innocent questions about his mother's death.3. **The News of Her Death**: A month later, Robert returned to the beach, but Wendy was not there. He felt compelled to visit her cottage to inquire about her absence. It was then he learned from Wendy's mother that Wendy had passed away due to leukemia.4. **Feelings of Guilt**: Robert felt guilty and ashamed upon hearing this news because he realized that during their only meeting, Wendy was perhaps trying to find joy despite her illness, and he did not treat her with kindness or empathy.Given these reflections, Robert's guilt stems from his previous behavior toward Wendy. He was rude and dismissive during their The answer is 'B. treat the girl nicely a month ago'. Robert felt guilty because he didn't treat Wendy nicely during their initial encounter. Despite her efforts to bring some light

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer the question about what the man learned from the little girl, we need to reflect on the narrative and its central themes.1. **Context of the Story**: The story centers around the interactions between Robert and Wendy, a little girl who approaches him at the beach during a difficult time in his life. Robert is grieving the recent loss of his mother, which has left him feeling depressed and out of balance.2. **Wendy's Perspective**: Despite her own struggles with leukemia, Wendy embodies a sense of joy and wonder. She approaches life with a simple but profound appreciation for the little things around her, as seen in her enjoyment of building in the sand and her belief that sandpipers bring joy.3. **The Climactic Moment**: When Robert learns of Wendy's passing and receives her drawing, it encapsulates the lesson she unconsciously imparted to him: "A Sandpiper to Bring You Joy." This signifies finding joy in small, everyday occurrences and connections, even amid sadness or hardship.4. **Reflections on the Lesson Learned**: The story concludes on a hopeful note with both Robert and Wendy's mother finding solace and smiles despite their grief. The lesson Wendy leaves behind is one of finding joy and meaning in everyday life, The answer is 'D. A person should enjoy each living day.'

Q: article:
            An allowance is an important tool for teaching kids how to budget, save and make their own decisions. Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly.
How large an allowance is appropriate? Experts say there is not right amount. Actual amounts differ from region to region, and from family to family.
To set an appropriate allowance for your child, work up a weekly budget. Allow for entertainment expenditures such as movies and snacks. Next, include everyday expenses such as lunch money, bus fare, school supplies. "If you make the child responsible for these ' ills'," says Josephine Swanson, a consumer specialist, " he or she will learn to budget for necessary expenditures."
Finally, add some extra money to make saving possible. If you can, keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends. A child whose purchasing power falls away below his peers' can feel left out.
It can be tough, but avoid excusing your children when they make a mistake with their allowance. When Brooke Stephens was ten and growing up in Jacksonville, her mother gave her $5 a week, $1.75 of which was for bus fare and lunch." If you lose your money," Brooke's mother told her, "you walk home."
One week the girl spent all her allowance in a candy store, then she called home for a ride. " Mom made me walk home," recalls Stephens, now a financial planner in Brooklyn. " At first I was angry. But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson. "
Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily chores. Kids should help around the house not because they get paid for it but because they share responsibilities as members of a family. You might, however, pay a child for doing extra jobs at home, which can develop his or her initiative.
            question:
            Which of the following is the possible title of the passage?
            options:
            ["A. How to develop a child's initiative.", 'B. How to work up an amount of pocket money.', 'C. How to teach a child to save money.', 'D. How to teach a child about money.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
The passage discusses various aspects of giving children an allowance. It mentions the importance of teaching kids how to budget, save, and make their own financial decisions. The passage covers several key points:1. Allowances help children learn to budget and save by making their own financial decisions and learning from mistakes. 2. There isn't a specific right amount for allowances; it varies by region and family.3. It suggests setting an allowance based on a child's weekly budget, including expenditures like entertainment and daily expenses.4. The allowance should allow the child to save a little extra money and be in line with their peers.5. Avoid excusing children's mistakes with their allowances to reinforce the lesson of managing money.6. Allowances should not be tied to daily chores but can be tied to optional extra jobs.Based on these points, the passage is broadly about teaching children how to manage and understand money through the use of an allowance. Although it touches on budgeting and saving, the primary focus is broader, covering how an allowance teaches various financial lessons.Given these considerations, the most appropriate title among the provided options is 'D. How to teach a child about money.', as it captures the broad educational intention of the allowance system depicted in the passage. Thus, the answer is D The answer is D. How to teach a child about money.

            It can be inferred from the passage that if a child is given an allowance, he or she may   _  .
            options:
            ['A. spend all the money very soon', 'B. be spoiled and finally ruined', 'C. feel responsible and careful about money', 'D. lost the money and can not return home']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To infer from the passage what a child might do if given an allowance, we should look at the main points discussed in the text:1. Allowance is used to teach children budgeting, saving, and making decisions, with the understanding that they will learn from mistakes like spending foolishly.   2. The allowance amount varies, but it should cover entertainment, everyday expenses, and saving while aligning with peers' allowances.   3. Consequences of spending all allowance include learning important lessons, as shown by Brooke's story, where she spent all her money on candy and had to walk home, learning responsibility.4. The text suggests that allowances should not be tied to daily chores since chores are part of family responsibility, though children can earn extra money for additional tasks.Based on these points, the inference is that giving a child an allowance helps them learn how to manage money, potentially leading them to be more responsible and careful financially. The story of Brooke indicates that children might spend their allowance quickly but will also learn from such experiences, leading to increased money management skills.Thus, the inference aligns best with the idea that, although a child might initially spend all their money quickly (indicating option A), the goal is for them to become careful and responsible about money in the long The answer is C. feel responsible and careful about money

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the implied message in the passage, let's examine each of the provided options closely in relation to the text:A. "paying children for their housework is no good"- The passage states, "Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily chores. Kids should help around the house not because they get paid for it but because they share responsibilities as members of a family." This suggests that paying children for typical housework is not recommended, as chores are part of family responsibilities.B. "a child's initiative can be developed if he or she is paid for all the housework"- The passage mentions, "You might, however, pay a child for doing extra jobs at home, which can develop his or her initiative." This implies paying for extra, beyond-the-norm tasks can help develop initiative, but it does not suggest paying for all housework contributes to this.C. "children may feel lost and lonely if they have no pocket money"- The text does not explicitly talk about children feeling lost and lonely without pocket money. It does mention keeping an allowance "in line with that of his friends" to prevent feelings of being left out, but not specifically "lost and lonely."D. "children may learn to put The answer is A. "paying children for their housework is no good"

            Shyness is the cause of much unhappiness for a great many people. Shy people are anxious and self-conscious; that is, they are over concerned with their own appearance and actions. Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes?
It is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must affect people unfavorably. Adperson's self concept is reflected in the way he or she behaves and the way a person behaves affects other people's reactions. In general, the way people think about themselves has a deep effect on all areas of their lives. Shy people ,have low self-esteem , are likely to be passive and easily influenced by others. They need reassurance(,) that they are doing "the right thing". Shy people are very sensitive to criticism. It makes them feel inferior .They also find it difficult to be pleased by praises because they believe they are unworthy of praise . A shy person may respond to a praise with a statement like this one:" You're just saying that to make me feel good .I know it's not true." It is clear that, while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful. Can shyness be completely got rid of ,or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can overcome shyness with determination. It is important for people to accept their weaknesses as well as their strengths, for example, not fair for them to label themselves inferior because they have to be realistic. Living on the impossible leads to absence of inferiority. Each one of us has his or her own characteristics. We are interested in our own personal ways.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine which option is correct according to the given article, let's consider the context in which "self-awareness" is discussed.1. **Understanding Self-Awareness in the Text**:    - The article mentions, "It is clear that, while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful."   - This implies that self-awareness itself is positive but can become negative if taken to excess.2. **Evaluating the Options**:   - **A. harmful to people**: This could seem applicable at first because overdoing self-awareness is harmful, but initially, self-awareness is described as healthy, indicating not inherently harmful.   - **B. a weak point of shy people**: The article doesn’t specifically state that self-awareness is a weak point of shy people. It mentions that shy people overdo self-awareness, but self-awareness itself isn’t labeled as a weakness.   - **C. the cause of unhappiness**: The article suggests that overdoing self-awareness can lead to unhappiness or negative feelings, but self-awareness itself is not directly stated as the cause of unhappiness.   - **D. a good characteristic**: The article explicitly calls self-awareness "a healthy quality," which equates to it being a good The answer is D. a good characteristic

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the shy people's reaction to praise based on the article provided, let's analyze the relevant portion of the text.The article mentions that shy people find it difficult to be pleased by praise because they believe they are unworthy of it.

This response clearly shows that shy people react to praise by doubting its sincerity and truthfulness. They are likely to believe that the praise is not genuine or deserved.Now, let's evaluate the options:- A. They are pleased by it: This contradicts the article, which states shy people find it difficult to be pleased by praise.- B. They feel it is not true: This aligns with the article, which shows shy people doubting the truth of the praise.- C. They are very sensitive to it: While shy people are sensitive to criticism, the article specifically discusses their belief about the truth of the praise concerning their reaction.- D. They feel they are worthy of it: This is not supported, as the article states they feel unworthy of praise.Based on the analysis of the text, the most accurate option is:B. They feel it The answer is B. They feel it is not true.

The passage discusses the negative effects of shyness on individuals, indicating that shy people are anxious, self-conscious, and overly concerned about their appearance and actions.2. It mentions that such thoughts lead to unfavorable feelings, affecting a person's self-concept, behavior, and consequently, the reactions of others.3. The passage elaborates that shy people usually have low self-esteem, are passive, easily influenced, and need reassurance. They are sensitive to criticism and often feel inferior.4. While self-awareness is recognized as healthy, the passage suggests that excessive self-awareness (a component of shyness) can be harmful.5. However, it also indicates that shyness can be overcome with determination and emphasizes the importance of accepting both strengths and weaknesses.Now, let's review the options:- 'A. help us to live up to our full development': This contradicts the passage, which suggests that shyness is unfavorable and obstructive rather than helpful.- 'B. enable us to understand ourselves better': While the passage discusses self-awareness, it highlights that shyness is linked with excessive self-scrutiny that is negative rather than constructive self-understanding.- 'C. block our chances for a successful The answer is 'C. block our chances for a successful life': This aligns with the passage, which mentions that shyness leads to low self-esteem and unfavorable feelings, obstructing

Q: article:
            A new Canada Prize for the Arts and Creativity could be in place by 2010, with large cash prizes for emerging   artists in dance, music, theatre and visual arts. 
The prize is the idea of Tony Gagliano and David Pecaut, founders of the Luminato festival,who were able to convince the federal government to back it. The federal budget has allocated $25 million to support the awards open to emerging artists. The aim is to create a prize that has the prestige   of a Nobel Prize.    
"When you think about the major prizes of the world ---- the Nobel Prize in Sweden,the Kyoto prizes in Japan or the Booker Prize in the U.K . --- they bring great honor and opportunity to the countries that award them," Pecaut said."The idea here is that every year,the Canada prizes will be awarded to the very best promising emerging artists around the world in those four fields. " 
   A jury   of international experts would judge the 12 finalists,who would come to Canada and perform or show their work in public to win the Canada prizes.The performances would be televised, allowing Canadians across the country to see it.
The federal government liked the idea of such an international prize that would advance Canada's brand,draw tourists and arts professionals from around the world.For the Canadian arts community, one of the greatest challenges is connecting to that international arts world to come up with co-productions and foreign investment and touring chances.
    A group is working toward establishing the prize by 2010,with potential for semi-final rounds to take place about the same time as the Vancouver Olympic Games."Thirty or forty years from now,the future outstanding dancers and performers will look back and say, 'I broke out on the world scene in Toronto -- that's where I was discovered.' "
            question:
            Why did David Pecaut have the idea of founding a new Ganada Prize?
            options:
            ['A. To enlarge the content of the Luminato festival.', "B. To advance Canada's honor and opportunities.", 'C. To consider his own benefits from the prize.', 'D. To make more Canadians get world prizes.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine why David Pecaut had the idea of founding a new Canada Prize for the Arts and Creativity, we should closely examine the information given in the article.The article mentions that this prize is intended to be prestigious and comparable to notable international awards like the Nobel Prize. The key motivation, as highlighted by David Pecaut's quoted statement, is related to the benefits such international prizes bring to the countries that host them. Pecaut specifically mentions that the idea is for the Canada Prizes to bring great honor and opportunity by recognizing the best emerging artists worldwide. This implies a broader goal of advancing Canada's standing and reputation on the global arts stage, which lines up with the federal government’s interest in using the prize to enhance Canada's brand, attract tourists, and connect the Canadian arts community internationally.Now, let's evaluate each of the options:- A.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
The article discusses the creation of a new Canada Prize for the Arts and Creativity. Here is the relevant information from the article to consider each option:- The prize will be awarded to emerging artists in four fields: dance, music, theatre, and visual arts. This is a clear indication that the prize is divided into four parts, one for each of these fields. Therefore, this suggests that option B could be correct.- There will be 12 finalists judged by a jury of international experts. However, the article does not mention how many winners there would be, only finalists, so option A may not be well-supported.- The timeline mentioned for the establishment of the prize is by 2010, with no mention of the prize being held every four years. Therefore, option C does not seem to be supported by the information given.- The federal budget allocated $25 million to support the awards, but this does not mean each winner would receive $25 million. The money is meant to support the prize as a whole. Hence, option D is not correct.Given this evaluation, the most accurate option based on the article is:B. be divided into four detailed parts The answer is B. be divided into four detailed parts

Q: article:
            Looking good, feeling good
Born to a model mom and a suit maker dad, fashion was actually in my blood. I always had a strong desire to dress in a certain way and to stand out from the crowd.
I made my own toys when I was a young child and sewed my first skirt at just 10 years old. A friend's mother took one look at my skirt and told me that I should be a patternmaker. In high school I started making my own clothes, mostly changing other things because I never liked anything how it was when I bought it. During the last two years of school, I worked part-time for a small business that made hand-painted silk clothing and bags. The owner became the teacher who got me into design in the first place. Another useful bit of work experience then came when I worked at a showroom during fashion week and found it very exciting. From there I worked at a top clothing store while I got my business started.
For my business I started out with the idea that everything I did would be hand-made and one-of-a-kind, specially made for one individual who hopefully had the same tastes as me. Every morning I jumped out of bed, went to my studio and worked on my projects. This just showed how enthusiastic I felt about my work. And at night I even dreamed of new designs!
Fashion design is _ art. What I mean is that it's something close to you and something you can touch and feel, and actually interact with. My advice to any young person who wants to be a fashion designer is to get the basic skills early on, such as sewing and pattern-making. Even if you end up specializing, it's really important to understand all aspects of design in order to make high-quality clothes.
Also, if you dream of having your own clothing line, the best thing to do is start wearing your clothes. You have to try and do this because that's the way you're going to develop something that's all yours and unlike anyone else's. I passionately believe that the right clothing can make people feel better and give them more confidence.

Q: article:
            Microsoft just finished a three-month experiment operating an underwater data center.A server rack  with the power of about 300PCs was placed into a water-tight  steel container and lowered into the ocean off the coast of central California.
The unusual experiment was launched because current data centers are unpleasantly inefficient.They're built where energy and land are cheap (not close to where people actually live).And they waste so much energy cooling their massive computers.The ocean can solve those problems.The cold ocean floor sufficiently cools the computing components inside the pod.And since most people live near the ocean,placing data centers under water could potentially increase the speed at which customers could access the information stored in Microsoft's cloud.
The experiment was so successful that Microsoft operated the underwater data center for 75days longer than it had planned to.The next step is to get a larger pod,with about four times the computing power,under the ocean for testing.Unlike the first experiment,the next pod will also be equipped with turbines,which will transform the ocean's currents into electricity.It's not clear when,if ever,underwater data centers will become a possible product."Our first experiment was like dipping our pinkie toe in the water,and now we're going for the big toe,"said Lee,corporate vice president of Microsoft Research.
Microsoft is still analyzing the environmental impacts of the study.Data centers are both hot and loud,which could have damaging effects on ocean life.Microsoft found that the noise its underwater data center produced was drowned out by nearby shrimp and crabs.The data centers are also built from recyclable materials,and Microsoft believes that the total carbon footprint of underwater data centers will be"dramatically lower"than current land-based centers.
Given the growth in the cloud,industry analysts believe that most of the world's data centers have yet to be built.But building a data center takes at least two years-an  eternity in the fast-developing tech industry.As a result,Microsoft builds its data centers with the future in mind,installing far more computing power and space than it currently needs.
Lee believes that going under water can shift the building of data centers from construction projects to manufacturing jobs."What if we could mass-produce these pods on an assembly line?"he thought."We could deliver a data center,from conception to operation,in 90days.That's dramatically different than what's happening today."
            question:
            What is the advantage of an underwater data center?
            options:
            ['A. It can be lowered to the ocean floor easily.', 'B. It can cool computing components automatically.', 'C. It can be built close to the place where people live.', 'D. It can make information easily accessible to people.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the advantage of an underwater data center, let's analyze the relevant information from the article:1. **Cooling Efficiency**: The article mentions that underwater data centers leverage the cold ocean floor to efficiently cool computing components inside the pod. This automatically provides cooling, which addresses the inefficiency of land-based centers that require significant energy for cooling.2. **Proximity to Populations**: The article notes that since most people live near ocean bodies, placing data centers underwater could potentially increase data access speed for customers, implying that they can be built closer to where people live.3. **Environmental Considerations**: There is an environmental angle mentioned, where underwater data centers are expected to have a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional ones.Now, let's evaluate the options:- **Option A**: While the data center can be lowered to the ocean floor, this is not an advantage mentioned in the context of improving functionality or efficiency, but just part of the logistics.- **Option B**: The article explicitly states that the cold ocean floor sufficiently cools the computing components, indicating automatic cooling is a key advantage of underwater placement.- **Option C**: The article highlights proximity to the population as a potential advantage in terms of data access speed.- **Option D** The answer is **Option B**: It can cool computing components automatically. 

The key advantage mentioned in the article for underwater data centers is the ability to leverage the cold ocean

Microsoft is still analyzing the environmental impacts of the study.Data centers are both hot and loud,which could have damaging effects on ocean life.Microsoft found that the noise its underwater data center produced was drowned out by nearby shrimp and crabs.The data centers are also built from recyclable materials,and Microsoft believes that the total carbon footprint of underwater data centers will be"dramatically lower"than current land-based centers.
Given the growth in the cloud,industry analysts believe that most of the world's data centers have yet to be built.But building a data center takes at least two years-an  eternity in the fast-developing tech industry.As a result,Microsoft builds its data centers with the future in mind,installing far more computing power and space than it currently needs.
Lee believes that going under water can shift the building of data centers from construction projects to manufacturing jobs."What if we could mass-produce these pods on an assembly line?"he thought."We could deliver a data center,from conception to operation,in 90days.That's dramatically different than what's happening today."
            question:
            We can infer that the underwater data centers   .
            options:
            ['A. cause little harm to the ocean life', 'B. are more environmentally friendly', 'C. change the course of ocean currents', 'D. are easy to build in large quantities']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the correct inference about the underwater data centers, let's analyze each of the options based on the provided article:1. **A. cause little harm to the ocean life**: The article mentions Microsoft is analyzing environmental impacts and found that the noise produced by the data center was drowned out by nearby marine life like shrimp and crabs. This suggests that the noise impact might be minimal, but it doesn't necessarily confirm that overall harm to ocean life is little. This option may be partially correct, but the article emphasizes the need for further study.2. **B. are more environmentally friendly**: The article suggests that underwater data centers could have a "dramatically lower" total carbon footprint compared to current land-based centers. Microsoft built the data centers using recyclable materials. These points make a strong case for the inference that underwater data centers are more environmentally friendly.3. **C. change the course of ocean currents**: There is no mention in the article about data centers affecting ocean currents. While the second experiment involves building turbines to transform ocean currents into electricity, it doesn't imply that they would change the course of these currents. Therefore, this option is not supported by the article.4. **D. are easy to build in large quantities**: The article discusses the potential The answer is 'B. are more environmentally friendly'.

The article indicates that underwater data centers could potentially have a "dramatically lower" carbon footprint compared to traditional land-based data

Q: article:
            There was a king who gave his daughter a beautiful diamond necklace. The necklace was stolen and his people in the kingdom searched everywhere but could not find it. So the king asked to search for it and put a reward for$50,000 for anyone who found it.
One day, a clerk was walking home along a river when he saw something shinning in the river and when he looked, he saw the diamond necklace. He decided to try and catch it to get the $50,000 reward.
He put his hand in the river and tried to catch the necklace, but somehow missed it and didn't catch it. He took his hand out and looked again and the necklace was still there. He tried again.
But strangely, he still missed the necklace! He came out and started walking away, feeling sad. Just then, an old man walking by saw him, and asked him what was the matter. The clerk didn't want to share the secret with him, thinking he might take the necklace for himself, so he refused to tell him anything.
The old man could see this man was troubled. He again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tell anyone about it. The clerk told him about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing.
The old man then told him that perhaps he should try looking upward, toward the branches of the tree, instead of in the river. The clerk looked up and true enough, the necklace was hanging on the branch of a tree. He had been trying to take a reflection of the real necklace all this time.
            question:
            The clerk tried to get the diamond necklace to   _  .
            options:
            ['A. make the king happy.', 'B. keep it for himself.', 'C. get the big reward.', 'D. sell it at a high price.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
The story describes how the king offered a reward of $50,000 to anyone who found the stolen diamond necklace. When the clerk saw something shining in the river, he believed it was the necklace and attempted to retrieve it to claim the reward. There is no indication in the story of the clerk wanting to keep the necklace for himself permanently or planning to sell it. His motivation appears to be driven by the potential of receiving the reward offered by the king. Therefore, the most logical answer is:C. get the big reward. The answer is C. get the big reward.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
The question asks about the clerk's state or actions before the old man inquired about his problem. Let's dissect the narrative:1. The clerk was attempting to retrieve the diamond necklace from the river, which turned out to be a mere reflection.2. After repeated failed attempts, the clerk was disheartened by his inability to capture the necklace, despite it seemingly being within reach.3. Consequently, he walked away from the river, feeling sad and probably frustrated over his unsuccessful efforts and the lost opportunity to claim the reward.Considering these points:- Option A ("was searching in the water"): This is true since he was trying to catch the necklace's reflection, but the actual searching had ceased once he started walking away, feeling despondent.  - Option B ("was trying to find help"): Incorrect. There’s no mention of him seeking help before the old man approached him.  - Option C ("felt rather tired"): While the text doesn't explicitly mention tiredness, the clerk's sadness could imply emotional fatigue but isn't explicitly stated.  - Option D ("was not feeling good"): This aligns with his emotional state after being unable to catch the necklace and leaving the river. The most reasonable answer, given the context, is that before the old man asked The answer is D. was not feeling good

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:1. **Summary**: The story revolves around a king's lost diamond necklace. A clerk sees a shining object in the river and assumes it's the necklace. Despite multiple attempts, he cannot catch it. An old man suggests looking upward, revealing the necklace hanging from a tree branch. The clerk was misled by the reflection in the water.2. **Themes**:   - **Perception vs. Reality**: The clerk was focused on the river, chasing a reflection rather than the actual necklace. The story emphasizes the importance of looking at things from different perspectives.   - **Problem-Solving**: By receiving advice from the old man, the clerk changes his approach and succeeds.3. **Analysis of Options**:   - **A. A beautiful diamond necklace**: Although the necklace is central to the story, this title misses the lesson or theme.   - **B. A king's promise**: This is misleading, as the king's promise of a reward is a minor detail.   - **C. A lucky young clerk**: While the clerk finds the necklace, luck isn't the story's The answer is D. Changing the way of thinking

This title encapsulates the main theme of the passage, which is about altering one's perspective to solve a problem. The clerk

Q: article:
            The man who admitted to killing an Italian woman inside her East Harlem apartment said he was possessed by an "evil spell  ," police said Thursday.
    Bakary Camara, 41, who once dated the murdered woman, penned his admission of guilt in a three-page letter folded in his pocket as he tried to kill himself after policemen burst into his home. Kelly, a policeman, said "He says that there was an evil spell that was cast on him."
Camara, who was in stable condition at St. Barnabas Hospital, was later charged with the murder of Rita Morelli.
    The 36-year-old woman was getting a degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College as she waited tables at Caffe Buon Gusto on the upper East Side, police said. Camara called 911 from a payphone after killing the lively Morelli on Nov. 23.
    Her body was later found in her E. 120th St. home. She was hanged and had knife wounds to her throat and chest.
    Policemen began dialing numbers from Morelli's cell phone and when Camara picked up, a detective recognized his voice as the man who called in the report of a dead body, police said. When officers went to Camara's home, he locked himself inside, forcing policemen to burst down the front door to catch him.
    "He is standing there with a knife pointed at his chest," Kelly, a policeman, said. "He makes threatening statements as to the fact that he killed the woman. He then stabs himself in the chest."
Camara, who told police he served six years in prison for robbery back in his native country, was still waiting to be charged with murder Thursday.
    Morelli left her hometown of Spoltore, Italy, five years ago to fully experience the arts and music culture of the big city, her family said.
            question:
            The reason why Camara killed the woman was   _  .
            options:
            ["A. he didn't love her any more", "B. the passage didn't tell us clearly", 'C. he killed her by mistake', 'D. he loved her dearly']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the reason why Camara killed the woman, we need to carefully examine the details provided in the article.1. Camara admitted to the murder, indicating a level of culpability, and wrote a three-page letter admitting guilt.2. According to the police, Camara said he was possessed by an "evil spell" when he committed the murder. This implies that he may have felt he was not entirely in control of his actions.3. The article does not provide further explanation or details about their past relationship or any specific motive beyond this claim of possession.4. No evidence suggests that the killing was accidental or a case of mistaken identity.5. The article also doesn't state that the murder was due to lack of love or contrasting feelings towards her.Considering the provided information, it becomes apparent that the article doesn't explicitly state a clear, rational reason for the murder beyond the claim of an "evil spell". Therefore, the best answer given the options is:**B. the passage didn't tell us clearly** The answer is B. the passage didn't tell us clearly

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine which of the options is true according to the passage, let's analyze each option:A. Morelli and Camara are both Italians.  - According to the passage, Rita Morelli is Italian as she left her hometown, Spoltore, Italy, but there is no information suggesting that Camara is Italian. In fact, it mentions Camara served time in prison in his native country, implying he is not from Italy. Therefore, this statement is false.B. Camara will be sentenced to six years in prison.  - The passage does not mention any sentencing for Camara. It only states that he was charged with murder. Thus, this statement is speculative and cannot be determined as true.C. Camara was once in prison for six years.  - The passage states, "Camara, who told police he served six years in prison for robbery back in his native country." This confirms that Camara indeed served six years in prison before. Hence, this statement is true.D. Camara was seriously wounded.  - The passage mentions that Camara stabbed himself in the chest but does not specify the severity of his wounds. It states that he was in stable condition at the hospital, which implies that he was not seriously wounded. The answer is C. Camara was once in prison for six years.

To determine what Camara did after killing the woman, let's analyze the information provided in the article:1. It is stated that Camara called 911 from a payphone after he killed Rita Morelli. This indicates an action taken directly after the murder.   2. When police officers found Camara, he had written a letter of admission and tried to kill himself once they arrived at his home. This suggests that after his call to 911, he was in a state of distress and attempted to commit suicide to escape the consequences.3. Given the options:   - A. "He called to report a dead body." - This is consistent with the statement that he called 911 from a payphone after the murder.      - B. "He called the hospital to save the woman." - There is no evidence in the article suggesting that he called a hospital; instead, he reported a dead body to 911.      - C. "He regretted and tried to kill himself but failed." - While he did attempt to kill himself after police arrived, the first action taken was the report to 911. The suicide attempt happened later.      - D. "He called the police and was ready to be arrested." - The article doesn't indicate The answer is A. He called to report a dead body.

Q: article:
            Many scientists today are convinced that life exists elsewhere in the universe---life probably much like that on our own planet. They reason in the following way.
  As far as astronomers can determine, the entire universe is built of the same matter. They have no reason to doubt that matter obeys the same laws in every part of the universe. Therefore, it is reasonable to guess that other stars, with their own planets, were born in the same way as our own solar system. What we know of life on earth suggests that life will arise wherever the proper conditions exist.
  Life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere. This eliminates  all those planets in the universe that are not about the same size and weight as the earth. A smaller planet would lose its atmosphere; a larger one would hold too much of it.
  Life also requires a steady supply of heat and light. This eliminates double stars, or stars that flare up suddenly. Only single stars that are steady sources of heat and light like our sun would qualify.
  Finally, life could evolve  only if the planet is just the right distance from its sun. With a weaker sun than our own, the planet would have to be closer to it. With a stronger sun, it would have to be farther away.
  If we suppose that every star in the universe has a family of planets, then how many planets might support life? First, eliminate those stars that are not like our sun. Next eliminate most of their planets; they are either too far from or too close to their suns. Then eliminate all those planets which are not the same size and weight as the earth. Finally, remember that the proper conditions do not necessarily mean that life actually does exist on a planet. It may not have begun yet, or it may have already died out.
  This process of elimination seems to leave very few planets on which earthlike life might be found. However, even if life could exist on only one planet in a million, there are so many billions of planets that this would still leave a vast number on which life could exist.
            question:
            The existence of life depends on all of the following factors EXCEPT   _  .
            options:
            ['A. the right amount of atmosphere', 'B. our own solar system', 'C. steady heat and light', 'D. the right distance from the sun']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine which factor does not contribute to the existence of life, let's analyze the options based on the information provided in the article:1. **The right amount of atmosphere (Option A):** The article mentions that life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere, as this eliminates planets that are not about the same size and weight as Earth. Therefore, this factor is crucial for the existence of life.2. **Our own solar system (Option B):** The article speaks about the universe in general and the conditions needed for life, not specifically about our own solar system. It discusses potential life on planets around other stars, suggesting that the specific solar system is not a necessary factor for life. Thus, this could be the factor that is not essential for life.3. **Steady heat and light (Option C):** The article states that life requires a steady supply of heat and light, eliminating double stars or stars that flare up suddenly. A stable, single star like our sun is necessary for life. Hence, this factor is important for the existence of life.4. **The right distance from the sun (Option D):** The article explains that for life to evolve, a planet must be at an appropriate distance from its sun depending on the sun's strength The answer is Option B: our own solar system. This is because the article discusses conditions for life that are applicable to planets around stars in the universe in general, not just

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine which statement is incorrect, let's evaluate each option in the context of the article:Option A: "The planet must be as big and heavy as the earth."- The article supports this statement, explaining that life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere, which is possible only on planets that are about the same size and weight as Earth. A smaller planet would lose its atmosphere, and a larger planet would hold too much of it.Option B: "Proper conditions are essential to the existence of life."- The article supports this statement. It discusses the necessity of proper conditions, such as the right atmosphere, a steady supply of heat and light, and the correct distance from its sun, for life to exist.Option C: "Double stars can provide steady light and heat."- This statement is incorrect. The article explicitly states that life requires a steady supply of heat and light, which eliminates double stars or stars that flare up suddenly. Only single stars, like our sun, are considered steady sources of heat and light.Option D: "The distance between a planet and its sun should be right."- The article supports this statement. It states that for life to evolve, the planet must be just the right distance from its sun, depending on the sun's strength The answer is Option C: "Double stars can provide steady light and heat."

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine what kind of planet might NOT support life based on the article, let's evaluate each of the options provided:1. **A. Most of the planets of the stars.**   - According to the article, most of the planets around stars would not support life because many of them are either too far from or too close to their stars, or not the right size and weight similar to Earth. Hence, planets that do not meet these conditions would likely not support life.2. **B. Stars similar to our sun.**   - The article suggests that stars similar to our sun are actually more likely to support life because they provide a steady supply of heat and light without flaring up, which is necessary for life. Therefore, this option does not describe planets that might not support life.3. **C. Planets similar to the earth.**   - The article implies that planets similar to Earth, in terms of size, weight, and distance from a similar sun, are more likely to support life. Therefore, this option describes planets that are potential candidates for supporting life, not those that might not.4. **D. Planets with proper conditions.**   - "Planets with proper conditions" are those that have the potential to support life The answer is **A. Most of the planets of the stars.**

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the most appropriate option based on the passage, let's analyze the steps in the author's reasoning and the final conclusion suggested:1. **Universal Composition and Laws**: The author notes that the universe is made of the same matter and obeys the same laws everywhere, leading to the possibility that other stars with planets formed similarly to our solar system.2. **Requirements for Life**:   - **Atmosphere**: Life requires a specific type of atmosphere, which is only possible on planets similar in size and weight to Earth.   - **Steady Heat and Light**: Life needs a consistent source of heat and light, eliminating many stars that do not provide this.   - **Appropriate Distance from the Sun**: The planet must be the right distance from its star, which eliminates many planets that are too far or too close.3. **Process of Elimination**: By removing planets that do not meet these conditions, the author indicates that only a few planets could support life.4. **Conclusion**: Despite heavy elimination, the author suggests that even if life could only exist on one planet in a million, given the billions of planets, there would still be a vast number where life might exist.Now, let's evaluate the options:- **Option The answer is 'D. life could exist on a great number of planets.'**

Q: article:
            I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons.
What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities.
Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have.
Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort
Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests.
So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.
            question:
            The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.
            options:
            ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
The author explicitly states that human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. Let's break down the reasons mentioned in the article:1. Identity Issue: The author argues that cloning may prevent people from having their own unique identities, as they would be given someone else's genetic identity.2. Power Struggle: There is mention of a power and control dynamic over another person's physical identity, which compromises their rights and individuality.3. Ethical Concerns with Embryos: The author highlights that cloning involves killing embryos, as exemplified by the high failure rate seen in the cloning of Dolly the sheep.4. Health Risks: Cloning at this present time poses significant health risks to both the birth mother and the clone due to the high failure rates and associated dangers in the procedure.Each of these reasons is elaborated upon by the author, making it clear that there are four distinct arguments against human cloning presented in the article.Thus, the author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for 4 reasons.Answer: A. 4 The answer is A. 4

            question:
            According to the article, what is the author's opinion about identity?
            options:
            ['A. Cloning itself gives parents great power over identity.', "B. People's identity is completely determined by their genes.", "C. Government has the rights to confirm people's identities.", 'D. Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the author's opinion about identity based on the article, let's analyze the relevant portion:1. The author raises a concern regarding identity, stating: "What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity?"2. The concern is about cloning potentially compromising an individual's right to have a unique identity, as cloning could result in individuals being given someone else's genetic makeup.3. The author states: "True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities."From these points, we can deduce that the author's opinion is that cloning may hinder individuals from having their own unique identities because it involves replicating someone else's genetic identity.Thus, the correct answer is:'D. Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities.' The answer is 'D. Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities.'

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To address the question based on Paragraph 4 of the article, we need to analyze the content it provides:Paragraph 4 discusses the difficulty and ethical concerns associated with cloning, illustrated by the example of Dolly the sheep. It mentions that Dolly was one of over 200 sheep embryos used in the cloning process, and hers was the only one that successfully resulted in a cloned animal. The text highlights the high failure rate, implying a significant amount of effort with limited successful outcomes. Now let's evaluate each option:- **A. human cloning is much more difficult than animal cloning**: While the paragraph primarily talks about the failure rate in sheep cloning, it doesn't provide a direct comparison between human and animal cloning difficulties.  - **B. there are 200 sheep successfully cloned**: This option is incorrect, as the paragraph clearly states that only one out of more than 200 sheep embryos survived, not 200 successful clones.- **C. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort**: This seems to align with the paragraph’s emphasis on the high failure rate (one success out of over 200 attempts), suggesting that cloning could indeed involve wasting considerable effort.- **D. numbers of baby animals are likely to be created by cloning**: This is not The answer is C. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort

Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the best title for the passage, we need to consider the main argument and purpose of the text.1. The first paragraph introduces the topic of cloning and suggests that many aspects of cloning depicted in movies are false. It then states the author's position that human cloning is wrong, providing a preview of the reasons to follow.2. The subsequent paragraphs detail the author's reasons for opposing human cloning:   - Concerns about identity and genetic rights.   - Issues of power and control associated with cloning.   - Ethical concerns regarding the high failure rate and the destruction of embryos, as illustrated by the example of Dolly the sheep.   - The physical risks to the birth mother and the clone.3. The conclusion reiterates that the risks outweigh the benefits and highlights ethical considerations regarding identity and the sanctity of life.Based on this analysis, the main focus of the passage is on arguing against human cloning due to ethical, identity-related, and safety concerns. - Option A, "What Is Human Cloning," does not accurately reflect the passage's content, as it doesn't primarily explain the process of human cloning.- Option B, "Human Cloning Is Wrong," succinctly captures the main argument of the text.- Option C, "How Does Human Cloning H The answer is 'B.

            As a teenager, Simon Weston wasn't particularly good at his studies, but he was a good football player. He could also be naughty sometimes so his mother decided Simon should join the army when he was sixteen to teach him some discipline .
She was right; Simon really enjoyed army life and became a well-respected member. However, Simon's life was changed forever in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, which belong to Britain, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared war . Simon was on board a ship taking troops to the Falklands when it was attacked and set on fire. In an act of great heroism, Simon tried to save one of his friends from being burnt alive. Sadly, he failed and was seriously burnt himself. At the age of 21, Simon's life seemed over.
Simon had 70 operations to rebuild his face and body. He was so badly burnt that his mother walked past him in the hospital without recognizing her son. Simon struggled to call out, "Mum, it's me, Simon." Hearing his voice, his mother broke down in tears. Many thought Simon would die, but to everyone's astonishment, he survived. Although he experienced terrible pain, Simon never gave up hope. After months of treatment, Simon slowly started to recover and, although he would be terribly scarred for the rest of his life, he was able to leave hospital.
This was when _ . The physical pain slowly disappeared; however, the emotional pain became worse. Simon started to gout but was wounded by the stares of people who looked at him like he was some kind of freak . He felt like saying, "I wasn't born like this you know. I was injured defending my country." It took great courage for Simon to continue to go out.
Eventually, Simon became involved in charity work and met his wife Lucy with whom he has three children. Life has never been the same for Simon but his Bravery is an example to us all.

            Simon's mother wanted him to join the army because   _  .
            options:
            ['A. he liked the life in the army', 'B. she wanted him to be fit', 'C. he was very good at playing sports', 'D. she felt it would change his behavior.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the reason Simon's mother wanted him to join the army, we need to refer to the information provided in the article. Here's the relevant excerpt:"As a teenager, Simon Weston wasn't particularly good at his studies, but he was a good football player. He could also be naughty sometimes so his mother decided Simon should join the army when he was sixteen to teach him some discipline."Based on this excerpt, Simon's mother decided that joining the army would instill discipline in him. Simon being "naughty sometimes" implies that his behavior needed improvement, and his mother believed the army would provide the necessary change.Now, let's evaluate the options:- Option A: "he liked the life in the army" - This is incorrect because it was not a preference for army life that led to the decision.- Option B: "she wanted him to be fit" - This is not mentioned in the article as a reason for joining the army.- Option C: "he was very good at playing sports" - While Simon was a good football player, this is not cited as the reason his mother wanted him in the army.- Option D: "she felt it would change his behavior." - This aligns with the information that she wanted him to join to teach him discipline The answer is Option D: "she felt it would change his behavior."

She was right; Simon really enjoyed army life and became a well-respected member. However, Simon's life was changed forever in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, which belong to Britain, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared war . Simon was on board a ship taking troops to the Falklands when it was attacked and set on fire. In an act of great heroism, Simon tried to save one of his friends from being burnt alive. Sadly, he failed and was seriously burnt himself. At the age of 21, Simon's life seemed over.
Simon had 70 operations to rebuild his face and body. He was so badly burnt that his mother walked past him in the hospital without recognizing her son. Simon struggled to call out, "Mum, it's me, Simon." Hearing his voice, his mother broke down in tears. Many thought Simon would die, but to everyone's astonishment, he survived. Although he experienced terrible pain, Simon never gave up hope. After months of treatment, Simon slowly started to recover and, although he would be terribly scarred for the rest of his life, he was able to leave hospital.
This was when _ . The physical pain slowly disappeared; however, the emotional pain became worse. Simon started to gout but was wounded by the stares of people who looked at him like he was some kind of freak . He felt like saying, "I wasn't born like this you know. I was injured defending my country." It took great courage for Simon to continue to go out.
Eventually, Simon became involved in charity work and met his wife Lucy with whom he has three children. Life has never been the same for Simon but his Bravery is an example to us all.
            question:
            What can we infer from the text about Simon?
            options:
            ['A. He succeeded in saving his friend in danger.', 'B. he became an excellent professional soldier.', "C. he didn't get along with other soldiers.", 'D. he found life in the army very terrible']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To infer information from the text about Simon, we need to carefully examine the given details:1. **He succeeded in saving his friend in danger:**   The text states that Simon attempted to save a friend from being burned alive but, regrettably, was unsuccessful. Therefore, option A is incorrect.2. **He became an excellent professional soldier:**   The text mentions that Simon wasn't particularly good at his studies as a teenager but seemed to thrive in the army, becoming a well-respected member. This suggests that he adapted well to army life and likely became proficient in his role, which aligns with option B. However, it does not explicitly state he was "excellent."3. **He didn't get along with other soldiers:**   There is no mention or implication in the text that Simon had difficulties getting along with other soldiers. On the contrary, he attempted to save a fellow soldier, indicating camaraderie. This implies option C is incorrect.4. **He found life in the army very terrible:**   Simon enjoyed army life, as mentioned in the text. The fact that he became a well-respected member suggests he did not find it terrible, which makes option D incorrect.Based on the evidence, the best inference we can make about Simon is related The answer is B. he became an excellent professional soldier.

Q: article:
            Our surroundings are being polluted faster than nature and man's present efforts cannot prevent it. Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities, and the growing use of man-made materials.
What can explain and solve this problem? The fact is that pollution is caused by man--by his desire for a modern way of life. We make "increasing industrialization" our chief aim. So we are often ready to offer everything: clean air, pure water, good food, our health and the future of our children. There is a constant flow of people from the countryside into the cities, eager for the benefits of our modern society. But as our technological achievements have grown in the last twenty years, pollution has become a serious problem.
Isn't it time we stopped to ask ourselves where we are going--and why? It makes one think of the story about the airline pilot who told his passengers over the loudspeaker, "I've some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we're making rapid progress at 530 miles per hour. The bad news is that we're lost and don't know where we're going." The sad fact is that this becomes a true story when spoken of our modern society.
            question:
            Man cannot prevent the world from being polluted mainly because  _  .
            options:
            ['A. the population of the world is decreasing fast', 'B. people use too many man-made materials', 'C. we have more and more industry', 'D. we are producing more cars, trucks and buses']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer this question, we need to focus on the primary reason given for why pollution continues despite efforts to prevent it. The article discusses several factors contributing to pollution:1. Increasing industrialization is identified as a major aim, which suggests a focus on industrial growth.2. The use of man-made materials is mentioned, but more in the context of simply being a part of the modern way of life.3. There is an influx of people from rural to urban areas, seeking modern life's benefits, which leads to larger cities and more pollution.4. Growth in the number of cars and transport industry is also mentioned.However, the main issue highlighted is the desire for a modern way of life, leading to industrialization being prioritized over maintaining a clean environment. Industrial growth is a central theme in the reasons provided for pollution becoming a more severe problem.Now, we look at the options:- Option A talks about population decrease, which is not a theme in the article; in fact, it mentions increasing numbers.- Option B mentions man-made materials, but it isn’t centrally framed as the main reason.- Option C points to increasing industrialization, which aligns with the article's point about industrial growth being a chief aim leading to pollution.- Option D mentions the production of The answer is Option C: we have more and more industry. 

This option aligns with the article's focus on increasing industrialization as a primary cause of pollution. The article

            options:
            ['A. man knows where the society is going', 'B. people do not welcome the rapid development of modern society', 'C. man can do little about the problem of pollution', 'D. the writer is worried about the future of our society']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the answer, we need to analyze the story about the airline pilot and its intended metaphorical message as it relates to the problem discussed in the article.1. The article talks about pollution being a product of man's pursuit of a modern lifestyle, with more industry, cars, and cities leading to environmental degradation.2. It questions whether society is prioritizing technological advancements and modern conveniences over essential natural resources and health.3. The anecdote about the airline pilot conveys that even though progress (represented by the plane's speed) is being made, there's uncertainty about the direction or destination (they are lost and don't know where they are going).Now, let's examine the options:- Option A suggests that "man knows where the society is going," which contradicts the story as it highlights that the pilot (society) doesn't know their direction.- Option B implies dissatisfaction with rapid development, which doesn't fully capture the essence of being lost or uncertain.- Option C suggests that "man can do little about pollution," but the anecdote is more about direction than capability.- Option D suggests "the writer is worried about the future of our society," which corresponds to the concern that, despite progress, the direction is unclear.The story metaphorically questions the purpose and direction of The answer is D. the writer is worried about the future of our society.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine why people crowd into the cities according to the article, we need to carefully consider the context provided. The article mentions that there is "a constant flow of people from the countryside into the cities, eager for the benefits of our modern society." This suggests that people are moving to cities because they are "anxious to enjoy the achievements of our society," such as technology, modern conveniences, and opportunities that come with an urban lifestyle.Let's evaluate the options to see which one aligns best with this interpretation:- Option A: "they want very much to find well-paid jobs" - While this might be a reason people move to cities, the article does not explicitly highlight finding well-paid jobs as the primary motivation. The focus is more on the broader benefits of modern society.- Option B: "they are anxious to enjoy the achievements of our society" - This is directly aligned with what the article states about people being eager for the benefits of modern society. It captures the desire to enjoy technological advancements and modern conveniences available in urban areas.- Option C: "they have become tired of their homeland" - The article does not mention people being tired of their homeland as a reason for moving to the cities.- Option D: "they have a strong wish to become The answer is B: they are anxious to enjoy the achievements of our society.

Q: article:
            Humans are naturally drawn to other life forms and the worlds outside of our own. We take delight in the existence of creatures and even whole societies beyond our everyday lives.
This sense of wonder is universal. Look at the efforts that scientists have made to find out whether life of some kind exists on Mars, and the popularity of fantasy    literature or movies like The Lord of the Rings. This sense of wonder draws us to each other, to the world around us, and to the world of make-believe, but have we gone so far in creating worlds of fantasy that we are missing the pleasure of other worlds that already exist all around us?
Human beings, as biologists have suggested, possess an inborn desire to connect with and understand other life forms. However, people, especially in big cities, often lead rather isolated lives. In a study of British schoolchildren, it was found that children by age eight were much more familiar with characters from television shows and video games than common wildlife. Without modem technology, a small pond could be an amazing world filled with strange and beautiful plants, insects, birds, and animals. When we lack meaningful interaction with the world around us, and sometimes even with our families and friends, we seek to understand and communicate with things that exist only in our imaginations or on a computer screen.
The world of make-believe is not necessarily bad, but when the world of fantasy becomes the only outlet for our sense of wonder, then we are really missing something. We are missing a connection with the living world. Other wonderful worlds exist all around us. But even more interesting is that if we look closely enough,we can see that these worlds, in a broad sense ,are really part of our own.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the most accurate option, let's closely examine the provided article and analyze the question with the given options:The article speaks about humans' natural inclination towards other life forms and the worlds beyond our own reality. It mentions that this sense of wonder and curiosity is universal and highlights how it draws us to both real and imagined worlds. It noted the efforts to find life on Mars and the popularity of fantasy literature and movies like "The Lord of the Rings" as examples of this universal sense of wonder.Now, let's assess the options:- **Option A: the close connection between man and the fantasy world**    This option addresses the link humans have with fantasy worlds. However, the article focuses on how humans are drawn to the wonder that both real and fantasy worlds offer, rather than only to the connection with fantasy worlds.- **Option B: the wonderful achievements of fantasy literature**    While the article mentions "The Lord of the Rings" as popular fantasy literature, it doesn't focus specifically on the achievements of fantasy literature.- **Option C: the fine taste of moviegoers around the world**    The article does not discuss the sophistication of moviegoers' tastes; rather, it emphasizes the universal curiosity that draws people to fantasy worlds.- **Option The answer is **D: the general existence of the sense of curiosity**

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the main purpose of the passage, let's analyze the key points and arguments presented:1. The passage begins by highlighting the human fascination with life forms beyond our own and the universal sense of wonder, evidenced by scientific endeavors to find life on Mars and the popularity of fantasy literature and movies.2. It poses a question about whether our creation and engagement with fantasy worlds might cause us to miss out on the existing wonders in the natural world.3. The passage mentions an inborn desire to connect with other life forms, yet notes that, especially in big cities, people lead isolated lives and children are more familiar with fictional characters than with real wildlife.4. There's a contrast between the accessible and wondrous real world and the world of make-believe, suggesting a lack of meaningful interaction with the natural world leads people to turn to imaginary realms.5. The conclusion of the passage suggests that while the fantasy world isn't inherently bad, over-reliance on it could mean missing the connection with the real, living world around us.Now, let's evaluate the options:- **Option A:** "To show us the hidden beauty in our world." This implies the passage primarily focuses on revealing the unnoticed beauty of the real world, but it only hints at this indirectly as part of The answer is the overall discussion about our connection to the natural world.

Q: article:
            Chocolate is good for your heart, skin and brain. Usually, people think that chocolate is bad for their health. They describe chocolate as "something to die for" or say "death by chocolate". Now they should bite their tongues! Evidence is showing that some kinds of chocolate are actually good for you in the following ways:
A happier heart
Scientists at Harvard University recently examined 136 studies on cocoa-- the main ingredient in chocolate-- and found that it does seem to strengthen the heart. Studies have shown heart benefits from increased blood flow. These benefits are the result of cocoa's chemicals, which seem to prevent both cell damage and inflammation . 
Better blood pressure
If yours is high, chocolate may help. Jeffrey Blumberg from Tufts University recently found that people with high blood pressure who ate 3.5ounces of dark chocolate per day for two weeks saw their blood pressure drop quickly.
Muscle magic
Chocolate milk may help you recover after a hard workout . _ 
Better for your skin
German researchers gave 24 women a half-cup of special cocoa every day. After three months, the women's skin was moister  and smoother. The research shows that chocolate helps protect and increase blood flow to the skin, improving its appearance.
Brain gains.
It sounds almost too good to be true, but research suggests that chocolate may improve your memory, attention span, reaction time, and problem-solving skills by increasing blood flow to the brain.
            question:
            What's the best title for this passage?
            options:
            ['A. Chocolate, a Healthy Food', 'B. More Chocolate, Less Health', 'C. Chocolate and Blood Pressure', 'D. Advice on Eating Chocolate']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
First, let's analyze the content of the article. The passage discusses various health benefits of chocolate, highlighting its positive effects on the heart, blood pressure, muscles, skin, and brain. It challenges the common belief that chocolate is entirely unhealthy, stating that certain types of chocolate, particularly those containing cocoa, can be beneficial to health.Now, let's consider the options provided for the title:- **A. Chocolate, a Healthy Food**: This title aligns well with the passage's message, which focuses on the health benefits of chocolate. It encapsulates the overall theme of the article by suggesting that chocolate can be part of a healthy diet.- **B. More Chocolate, Less Health**: This title contradicts the main message of the passage. While it might echo a common misconception about chocolate, it doesn’t accurately reflect the article's content, which emphasizes health benefits.- **C. Chocolate and Blood Pressure**: This title is too narrow. Although the passage mentions that chocolate can lower blood pressure, it also covers other health benefits, making this title unsuitable as it doesn't represent the entirety of the article.- **D. Advice on Eating Chocolate**: While this option hints at the subject matter, the passage is more focused on explaining the health benefits rather than providing specific The answer is A. Chocolate, a Healthy Food

And I hated circuses, especially the animal acts -- men teasing lions, girls balancing on elephants and monkeys playing football. I knew that every trick a circus animal did was unnatural, achieved through strict training and quite possibly cruelty.
Happily, during my lifetime public attitudes and the law have changed. Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved.
When my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced.
As a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. "Animals belong in the wild," is a common -- and understandable -- complaint. But what do the animals themselves prefer?
Generally speaking, zoo animals have a longer life. But -- you may protest -- they are not free. What? Free to be hunted and killed, free to die of hunger or thirst? Maybe sitting in a cage eating bananas isn't so bad.
Not that such conditions are acceptable in modern zoos, due to the work of BIAZA, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. These days every zoo requires BIAZA's approval to operate, and the association sets the standards, observes conditions in zoos and develops animal-research programmes, both in the UK and abroad. BIAZA also organises the animal exchanges between zoos all over the world.
Consequently, today, most zoo animals are born and raised in zoos, live in large, comfortable enclosures and are cared for by well-trained, knowledgeable and caring zoo employees. Of course it's no substitute for living in the wild but unfortunately this isn't always possible. Meanwhile, why not visit your local zoo and decide for yourself?
            question:
            The passage is mainly about   _  .
            options:
            ['A. how zoos have improved', 'B. whether a zoo should be closed down', 'C. a new environmental organisation', 'D. the difference between zoos and circuses']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the main idea of the passage, let's break it down:1. **Introduction and Personal Experience**: The passage begins with the author's childhood experiences of visiting zoos and circuses, which were not enjoyable and seemed unfair to the animals involved. This sets a background for discussing changes over time.2. **Change in Public Attitudes and Law**: The author mentions a positive change in public attitudes and laws towards circuses and zoos, highlighting an evolution in how animals are treated.3. **Conditions of Zoos in the Past**: The passage describes past conditions in zoos, where animals were kept in small cages, appeared bored, and had minimal information provided about them. This implies that zoos were not seen as suitable environments for animals back then.4. **Comparison with the Wild**: There's a debate over whether it's better for animals to be free in the wild, where they face dangers, or in zoos, where they are safe but not free. This highlights the complexities of keeping animals in zoos.5. **Role of BIAZA**: BIAZA (British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums) is introduced as an organisation that ensures the modern standards of zoos. It oversees the conditions and encourages The answer is the improvement and development of zoos. This emphasizes the transformation zoos have undergone.6. **Current Conditions in Zoos**: The passage describes modern zo

            question:
            Which of the following roles are performed by BIAZA?
            options:
            ['A. Organising animal study projects and training zoo workers.', 'B. Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges.', 'C. Designing zoos and approving zoo operations.', 'D. Caring for ill animals and setting zoo standards.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the roles performed by BIAZA according to the article, we need to analyze the information given:1. The article mentions that BIAZA is responsible for setting the standards and observing conditions in zoos. This aligns with the task of checking zoo conditions.2. BIAZA requires every zoo to have its approval to operate, which is related to setting standards for zoos.3. The article states that BIAZA develops animal-research programs, indicating their involvement in animal study projects.4. BIAZA is also mentioned as organizing the animal exchanges between zoos all over the world.With this information, let's evaluate the given options:- Option A: "Organising animal study projects and training zoo workers." The article mentions organizing animal research programs but does not specifically mention training zoo workers, so this option is not entirely accurate.- Option B: "Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges." The article confirms both tasks: checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges. This matches the description in the article.- Option C: "Designing zoos and approving zoo operations." The article does not mention BIAZA designing zoos. While BIAZA approves zoo operations by setting standards, designing zoos is not mentioned.- Option D: " The answer is Option B: "Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges." This option aligns with the roles mentioned in the article, where it confirms that BIAZA is responsible

Q: article:
            In many countries, heart disease kills a lot of women and even more men. There are four major causes of this disease and these are smoking, poor or bad diet, a family history of heart disease and stressful work. Among these main wrong-doers, the most common cause is stress.
What is stress and how do you feel when you are under stress? Imagine you live alone - you are lying in bed at night and, suddenly, you hear someone in the kitchen. Immediately your heart begins to beat very fast and you feel that you can hardly breathe. What you are feeling is not stress, but fear. However, your body changes in the same way when you feel stress. That means that if you feel anxious and worried during an important examination, your heart may beat very fast and you may feel breathless too. You are experiencing stress. Another common situation in which a person is likely to feel stress is to have to do something, for example, performing a boring duty, every day.
Let us look at the case of Annie who was a nurse. She felt a lot of stress in her work and began to have very bad headaches at the end of the day. Each morning she woke up more tired than she was when she went to sleep. She did not want to go out in the evening with her friends and she felt unhappy all the time.
Finally, she sat down and thought about her life. She saw a lot of illness and death in her work but that was not the reason why she was under stress. The real reason was that she felt unable to make a positive decision in her job - she had to do what the doctors and sisters told her.
So, Annie went back to college for further study. When she graduated, she found a job where she
was part of a team as before, but where she had responsibility in making decisions. Her working hours were longer and her work more difficult than when she was a nurse but she enjoyed it. She felt she was in control of her life and her work. For Annie, stress in her old job had made her change her life and end a difficult situation. Stress in her new job became a good thing because it helped her achieve satisfaction in her life and in her work.
            question:
            Feeling   _   is one form of stress.
            options:
            ['A. tired', 'B. alone', 'C. anxious', 'D. breathless']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the context given in the article.1. **Understanding Stress in the Article**:    - The article defines stress by comparing it to fear. It mentions physical symptoms common to both stress and fear, such as a fast-beating heart and difficulty breathing.   - It provides an example of stress during an important examination, highlighting symptoms such as a fast heartbeat and feeling breathless. It refers to feeling "anxious and worried" in this context as experiencing stress.2. **Analysis of the Options**:   - **A. tired**: The text does mention Annie feels more tired when she wakes up than when she goes to sleep due to stress, but it does not directly connect "feeling tired" as a form of stress in the general description of stress.   - **B. alone**: The text describes a scenario of being alone at night leading to fear, not stress. The feeling of aloneness isn't directly tied to stress in the article.   - **C. anxious**: The text explicitly states that feeling anxious and worried during an important exam represents experiencing stress. This aligns directly with a form of stress.   - **D. breathless**: The description of feeling breathless is provided The answer is C. anxious

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer the question, we must analyze the relevant information given in the passage about heart disease and who it affects most.The passage states: "In many countries, heart disease kills a lot of women and even more men." Let's break this down:- This statement indicates that both men and women die of heart disease.- The key phrase here is "even more men," which suggests that although many women die from heart disease, the number of men who die from it is greater.Therefore, based on the passage, the correct interpretation is that more men than women die of heart disease.Given this analysis, the correct answer is:B. more men than women The answer is B. more men than women

            options:
            ['A. unhappiness', 'B. breakdown', 'C. satisfaction', 'D. responsibility']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the correct answer to the question about Annie's experience as a nurse, we need to identify what caused her stress in that role.The passage suggests that Annie experienced significant stress due to her lack of control over her work situation. It explicitly states that "the real reason [for her stress] was that she felt unable to make a positive decision in her job - she had to do what the doctors and sisters told her." This indicates a lack of autonomy and responsibility in her role as a nurse.Now, let's evaluate the provided options:- A. unhappiness: While Annie did feel unhappy, the passage specifies that the unhappiness was a result of stress, not lack of unhappiness itself.- B. breakdown: The passage does not mention a breakdown; while she felt stress, it does not suggest a breakdown.- C. satisfaction: This could be related, as satisfaction often involves feeling a sense of accomplishment and impact, but it is not directly the reason for the stress.- D. responsibility: This aligns with the reason given for Annie's stress. Her lack of responsibility, feeling like she could not make positive decisions, directly contributed to her stress.Therefore, the best answer is:D. responsibility The answer is D. responsibility

Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the major difference between Annie's new job and her old one, let's analyze the details provided in the article:1. **Annie's Old Job:**    - She worked as a nurse.   - She experienced a lot of stress.   - She did not have the ability to make decisions; she followed what the doctors and sisters told her.2. **Annie's New Job:**   - After further study, she found a job where she had responsibility in making decisions.   - Although the working hours were longer and the work was more difficult, she enjoyed it.   - She felt in control of her life and work.Upon examining these points, the primary difference highlighted between her old and new job is the aspect of "decision-making." In her new job, Annie is able to make decisions, while in her old job, she did not have this responsibility. This has been a significant change that positively impacted her work satisfaction and management of stress.Thus, the correct option is:'D. It involves decision-making.' The answer is 'D. It involves decision-making.'

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the total cost for a couple and their 10-year-old boy to take 5 tennis classes, we need to break it down step by step:1. **Identify the price per class for each person:**   - Adults pay PS4.8 per class.   - Under 16 (including the 10-year-old boy) pay PS3.30 per class.2. **Calculate the total number of classes each individual will attend:**   - Each person will attend 5 classes.3. **Calculate the total cost for each individual classification:**   - For one adult: PS4.8 per class × 5 classes = PS24.   - Since there are two adults, multiply by 2: PS24 × 2 = PS48.   - For the 10-year-old boy: PS3.30 per class × 5 classes = PS16.50.4. **Add up the costs for all family members:**   - Total cost for adults: PS48   - Total cost for the child: PS16.50   - Combined total: PS48 + PS16.50 = PS64.50.Thus, the couple and their 10-year-old boy should pay a total of **PS The answer is B.

Q: article:
            February 4, 2012 saw the take-off of a new rising NBA star-Jeremy Lin.
Among professional basketball players, Jeremy Lin's background is not typical. He graduated from Harvard University, which sends few players to the NBA, and he is the only Chinese-American NBA player. But when you watch him on the court, there is no doubt that he belongs there. He moves with speed and grace that demonstrate years of faithful practice, which is fueled by a love for basketball.
Lin's enjoyment of basketball actually began in Taiwan. When Lin's father moved to U.S., his interest in the sport only grew and he passed on this love of basketball to his son, introducing him to the game at the age of five. The young Lin spent much of his youth playing basketball for fun.
In high school, Lin dreamed of playing in the NBA. When he applied for college, he was not offered a single sports scholarship. However, after his admission to Harvard, he was offered a place on its college basketball team.
During Lin's time at Harvard, his basketball career began to speed up. He scored 1,482 points, making him one of the highest scorers in Ivy League history.
When he graduated, no professional teams offered Lin a contract, but he was invited to play in the NBA Summer League. He played well and ended up eagerly signing a contract with the Golden State Warriors.
At first,playing in professional games filled Lin with excitement. He treasured opportunities to meet players he had been watching on TV for years. But slowly, the excitement _ and was replaced by anxiety. In a few very difficult months, he was cut by two teams before the New York Knicks picked him up.
But he had the courage and determination to stick to his dream, so he put himself into hard training to get ready for his opportunity to come. Then his moment arrived on February 4, 2012,on which his excellent performance made him famous overnight. After that, he led the Knicks to their fifth straight victory.
The Associated Press called Lin "the most surprising story in the NBA". Knicks fans developed the nickname for him "Linsanity"  . Time magazine released its 2012 list of the 100 "Most Influential People in the World", Jeremy Lin included.
No doubt, Lin fever is continuing to spread if you haven't already caught "Linsanity", get ready.
            question:
            Which of the following elements is of little help in Lin's success?
            options:
            ["A. his father's influence", 'B. his devotion to basketball', 'C. his years of hard work', 'D. his graduation from Harvard University']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine which element is of little help in Jeremy Lin's success, let's analyze each option and its likely impact on his career:A. **His father's influence**: The article mentions that Lin's love for basketball began in Taiwan when his father passed on his interest in the sport. This suggests that his father's influence is a significant factor in sparking his early interest and involvement in basketball.B. **His devotion to basketball**: The article clearly emphasizes Lin's dedication to the sport, stating that he moved with speed and grace that demonstrated years of faithful practice. His devotion is directly linked to his skill development and performance, which are crucial for his success.C. **His years of hard work**: Again, the article points out Lin's intense practice and determination to improve, especially when he faced setbacks. This hard work is foundational to his success and eventual breakthrough in the NBA.D. **His graduation from Harvard University**: While graduating from a prestigious university like Harvard is an accomplishment, the article suggests that academic achievement did not directly contribute to his success in the NBA. Harvard is not known for producing many professional basketball players, and Lin was not offered sports scholarships for college. His success seems more linked to his skills and persistence rather than his Harvard graduation.Considering these The answer is "D. his graduation from Harvard University".

Q: article:
            Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to challenge our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they possessed. As a member of that group, you would likely inherit   that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be hesitant to really get behind yourself, fearing that your investment would not pay off. Even if you had the courage to follow your passion, your inner belief that you are not inherently talented would probably be a major drawback to investing your energy in your dream.
On the other hand, if you found a way to release that negative belief, a great flood of energy would pour forth, greatly increasing the likelihood of your success. How much energy we are willing to invest in the various ideas, dreams, and visions we carry within is like the money people are, or are not, willing to invest in the various products available for trade on the stock market. And in both cases, belief plays a key role in determining how willing we are to get behind something. One way to open up the possibility for greater success in our inner economies is to understand that belief is not the reliable guide we sometimes think. There are other more reliable things of success that we can put our faith in, such as passion, feeling, and sense. Some of the most successful investors in the stock market are the ones that go against the grain (to be something that one does not like doing), trusting their sense over the common opinion held by common people about what will work.
In the same way, we can learn to trust our heart's desires and our sense to guide us, questioning any beliefs that stand in the way of our ability to fully invest in ourselves. As we take out energy from limiting ideas about what is possible, we free up the resources that have the power to make our inner economy prosper.
            question:
            According to the passage, if a family of origin has passion for literature, the members of the family will probably_.
            options:
            ['A. teach literature', 'B. hate literature', 'C. write poems', 'D. enter the field of literature']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer the question, we need to understand the main concept of the passage regarding how beliefs and passions within a family can influence individual behavior and choices. The passage explains that beliefs and passions that are common in a family can be inherited by its members. It describes how a belief within a family (e.g., lack of musical talent) might hinder an individual from investing in that area, and that overcoming such beliefs can enhance one's chances of success. Now, applying this idea to the question at hand: If a family of origin has a passion for literature, the members of that family are likely to inherit that passion and be more inclined towards engaging with literature-related activities. The options provided are:- A. teach literature- B. hate literature- C. write poems- D. enter the field of literatureOption B can be immediately dismissed as it contradicts the concept of passion. Option A and C are specific activities related to literature, while option D is broader. Given that the passage discusses a general influence (not specific actions), option D, "enter the field of literature," aligns best with the notion of family passion leading members towards engaging in literature, without specifying how that engagement might manifest.Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:D. enter the The answer is 'D. enter the field of literature'

            question:
            We can put our faith in the following things of success except_.
            options:
            ['A. passion', 'B. feeling', 'C. sense', 'D. stock market']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine which option we cannot put our faith in for success according to the article, let's analyze each of the options provided:1. **Passion (Option A):** The article mentions that passion is one of the reliable things, alongside feeling and sense, that we can put our faith in for greater success. Therefore, passion is indeed suggested as one of the things of success.2. **Feeling (Option B):** Similarly, feeling is highlighted as a reliable guide to success in the article. The text suggests that feeling is something we can put our faith in instead of solely relying on beliefs.3. **Sense (Option C):** The article states that trusting one's sense is important and equates it to the behavior of successful investors who trust their own sense over common opinions. Therefore, sense is again something we can put our faith in for success.4. **Stock Market (Option D):** While the stock market is mentioned in the article, it is used primarily as a metaphor for the inner economy, where beliefs determine how much energy or faith we invest in ourselves. The stock market itself is not presented as a thing in which we place our faith for personal success within our inner economy.Considering the explanations above, the correct answer is:D. stock market The answer is 'D. stock market'

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the purpose of the author, let's analyze the content of the article and each of the provided options:1. **Summarizing the Article:**   - The article uses the analogy of the stock market to describe how an individual's inner beliefs can impact their success and personal growth, similar to how market trends are influenced by investors' willingness to invest.   - It suggests that negative beliefs can prevent us from pursuing passions or investing energy in our dreams.   - The author advises that releasing these negative beliefs can lead to increased energy and success.   - Furthermore, the author emphasizes the importance of trusting one's own feelings and desires over common beliefs for greater success.2. **Analyzing the Options:**   - **A. to teach us a lesson:** The article indeed conveys a moral lesson about personal beliefs and the impact on our personal growth and success.   - **B. to give us some useful suggestions:** The article provides suggestions on how to overcome limiting beliefs and invest in personal growth.   - **C. to tell us that our belief is not reliable:** This reflects a part of the message, but it is too narrow.

            Going Zero Waste means more than just managing the rubbish we create.It means reducing it too.While it might seem like a difficult thing to do, it's well worth it.And what better time to start than Christmas?
We need to copy the way Nature wastes nothing.Many things are created by human society that we know will soon become useless and be thrown out.How many plastic bottles or even PCs end up in the rubbish bin? Instead,we should design products that can be more easily repaired,reused and recycled.
Kamikatsu, a Japanese village,has already gone Zero Waste.The 2,000 villagers compost their leftovers,and recycle everything else.There are 34 different boxes at the re-cycling centre! Residents grumble about the inconvenience,but they also see the benefits.
People who live Zero Waste lives are careful about what they do.They never take more than they need.Reusing plastic bags at supermarkets is a great way to reduce waste.And those who plan before they shop avoid having to throw food out later.Also,it's best not to go food shopping when you're hungry:You'll be sure to buy too much!
Let's think about how to enjoy a Zero Waste Christmas.By sending recyclable cards,we can help our friends and family reduce waste.And what better way to enjoy the spirit of Christmas than with a real tree that can be replanted in the spring?
Going Zero Waste requires us to think more about what happens before and after we act.It takes ambition,and it's not always easy.But just think how good it would be,both for ourselves and for the environment, if we never had to waste anything.
            question:
            When is this passage probably written?
            options:
            ['A. After a Christmas.', 'B. Before Zero Waste starts.', 'C. Before a Christmas.', 'D. When Zero Waste is very popular.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine when this passage is probably written, let's analyze the content of the passage and the options provided:1. The passage discusses the concept of going Zero Waste, specifically mentioning the idea of starting this initiative during Christmas. This suggests a time before or leading up to Christmas.   2. The key point of timing mentioned in the passage is the encouragement to start a Zero Waste lifestyle specifically starting at Christmas time, which suggests preparing for an upcoming Christmas.3. There is no indication in the passage that Zero Waste has already gained widespread popularity (option D) or that it describes a scenario where Zero Waste has not yet started at all (option B). The passage is promoting the idea and gives examples of current practices like Kamikatsu village, meaning Zero Waste has begun but is not ubiquitous.4. Given the focus on "what better time to start than Christmas?" and discussing the ways to have a Zero Waste Christmas, it supports the notion of timing before the Christmas holiday happens (option C).Therefore, the most probable choice when the passage was written is:C. Before a Christmas. The answer is C. Before a Christmas.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer this question, we should analyze what the passage emphasizes in terms of actions to reduce waste.1. **Understanding the Context**: The passage discusses the concept of "Going Zero Waste," which involves more than managing existing rubbish. It highlights reducing the creation of waste as a proactive measure, taking inspiration from nature, where nothing is wasted.2. **Passage Details**:    - The passage emphasizes *reducing* waste creation, designing products to be repairable and recyclable, and managing existing rubbish effectively.    - It uses Kamikatsu as an example of a Zero Waste village where residents compost leftovers and recycle meticulously.    - Tips for individuals include reusing shopping bags, planning purchases to avoid food waste, sending recyclable cards, and using real trees that can be replanted.3. **Options Analysis**:   - **A. To stop using plastic bottles or even PCs**: The passage does not suggest stopping the use of these items entirely but encourages redesigning products for repair and recycling.   - **B. To create more things that can be repaired quickly**: While the passage mentions designing products to be repairable, it doesn't focus specifically on quick repairability as the main solution.   - **C. To avoid sending cards on Christmas**: The answer is not aligned with the passage's suggestions. Instead, the passage recommends sending recyclable cards to reduce waste during Christmas.

            It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: "R U awake?"
Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices
Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found.
The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten.
Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. " If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?" media expert Cheryl Olson says.
Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. " It' s a matter of balance," says Olson." You've got to work on it. "
Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. "It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, " says Rideout.
With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. " Kids should try," adds Rideout. " But parents might have to step in sometimes. "
            question:
            Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?
            options:
            ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer the question of why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option.1. **A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.**   - The article mentions a "huge explosion in mobile devices" and highlights that the number of kids with cell phones has increased significantly over the years (from four out of ten to seven out of ten in five years). This directly supports the idea that more devices being available is a reason children are spending more time on them.2. **B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.**   - While the article does talk about new and exciting devices hitting stores, it does not specifically state that increased excitement is the main reason children spend more time on them. The focus is more on availability.3. **C. Because they have less other activities.**   - The article suggests a concern that kids might be missing out on other activities, but it doesn't explicitly state that having fewer non-electronic activities is why they're spending more time on devices. It mentions the importance of balance rather than a reduction in available activities.4. **D. Because they have less homework to do.**   - There is no mention in the article about the amount of The answer is A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.

Cheryl Olson is not surprised about kids' increasing use of mobile devices", 'D. most experts think teenagers should not use electronic devices for their studies']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To find out the answer, let's carefully analyze the passage and evaluate each of the given options:- **Option A**: "Brandon Blanco feels very annoyed about his late-night text". The passage mentions that Brandon is woken up by a loud noise and then reaches for his cell phone. However, it does not mention if he feels annoyed about receiving the text. Since there is no reference to his feelings about the text, this option cannot be concluded from the passage.- **Option B**: "The teenagers using mobile devices have increased by 30% in the past five years". The passage states that nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones, compared to four out of ten five years ago. This implies a significant increase in mobile device usage among kids. Calculating the percentage increase, we see it increased from 40% (4 out of 10) to 70% (7 out of 10), which is a 30% increase. Therefore, this statement is mentioned in the passage and can be considered a true conclusion.- **Option C**: "Cheryl Olson is not surprised about kids' increasing use of mobile devices". The passage mentions that Cheryl Olson, a media expert, comments on the situation by saying, "If you've got The answer is **Option B**: "The teenagers using mobile devices have increased by 30% in the past five years".

            question:
            Which of the following is an example of multitasking according to the passage?
            options:
            ['A. Watching TV while using the computer.', 'B. Talking on the phone while staying with others.', 'C. Playing video games on the Internet.', 'D. Listening to music while relaxing.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To find an example of multitasking according to the passage, we need to identify instances where someone is using more than one electronic device at a time, as this is described in the text. The passage specifically mentions multitasking as using more than one electronic device simultaneously, such as using a computer while taking a phone call and having the TV on in the background.Let's evaluate each option:- Option A: Watching TV while using the computer.  This scenario involves using more than one electronic device at the same time, as it involves watching TV and using the computer simultaneously. This fits the definition of multitasking as given in the passage.- Option B: Talking on the phone while staying with others.  Here, it mentions talking on the phone, but it does not reference using another electronic device at the same time, so it doesn't necessarily meet the passage's concept of multitasking given the context.- Option C: Playing video games on the Internet.  This activity involves focusing on one electronic device (playing video games on the computer or console online) and does not inherently involve using multiple devices at once.- Option D: Listening to music while relaxing.  Listening to music could potentially occur while doing another activity, but this option doesn't specify using multiple devices simultaneously in the framework The answer is 'A. Watching TV while using the computer.'

Q: article:
            American researchers say drinking tea may help strengthen the body's defense system against infection. Doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, did the study. The team studied a chemical found in black, green, oolong and pekoe tea. This chemical is an amino acid called L-theanine. The scientists say it may increase the strength of gamma delta T cells. That's the letter T, not the drink. Gamma delta T cells are part of the body's defense.
First, the researchers mixed some of these cells with antigens found in the amino acid . Antigens help the body react to infection. Then the scientists added some bacteria. Within twenty-four hours, the cells produced a lot of interferon, a substance that fights infection. Cells not mixed with the antigens did not produce interferon.
In the second part of the study, eleven people drank five to six cups of black tea every day. Ten other people drank the same amount of instant coffee. That is dried coffee mixed with hot water.
Two weeks later, and again two weeks after that, the researchers tested the blood of all twenty-one people. They also looked at what happened when they added bacteria to the blood cells. They found that the tea drinkers produced five times more interferon after they started drinking tea. The coffee drinkers did not produce interferon.
Doctor Jack Bukowski led the study. He says the antigens added to the gamma delta T cells were responsible for the increased reaction to the bacteria. He says that the study also showed that the cells were able to remember the bacteria and fight them again the next time.
Earlier research already has found that tea can help prevent heart disease and cancer. Doctor Bukowski says the new study must be repeated by more people. "If the findings prove to be true," he says, "then tea drinking might also help protect against bacterial infections." He says the amino acid L-theanine could be removed from the tea and used as a drug to strengthen the body's defenses.
            question:
            We may know from the text that   _   can be found in different kinds of tea.
            options:
            ['A. L-theanine', 'B. Gamma delta T cells', 'C. interferon', 'D. bacteria']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
The question asks for information regarding what can be found in different kinds of tea, according to the text.1. **Understanding the context**:   - The article discusses a study on tea and its effects on the body's defense system against infection.   - Specifically, it focuses on a certain chemical or compound in tea that could have beneficial effects.2. **Identifying relevant information**:   - The text mentions "a chemical found in black, green, oolong, and pekoe tea," which is identified as "an amino acid called L-theanine."3. **Reviewing the options**:   - Option A: L-theanine is the chemical explicitly mentioned in the text as being found in different kinds of tea.   - Option B: Gamma delta T cells are a component of the immune system, not something found in tea.   - Option C: Interferon is a substance produced by the immune cells, not found in tea.   - Option D: Bacteria are not a component of tea.4. **Conclusion**:   - Based on the information from the text, L-theanine (Option A) is the correct answer as it is the compound found in different kinds of tea.Therefore, the answer is A. L-theanine. The answer is A. L-theanine.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine why tea may help strengthen the body's defense system, we can analyze the information given in the article.1. The study conducted by Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers involved examining the effects of a chemical in tea, specifically L-theanine, on the body's defense system.2. The researchers focused on how tea affected gamma delta T cells, which are a part of the body's immune defense.3. The study showed that when these cells were mixed with antigens (components that trigger immune reactions) found in L-theanine, they produced interferon after encountering bacteria. 4. Interferon is a substance that fights infections in the body.5. The experiment found that those who drank tea produced significantly more interferon when exposed to bacteria compared to those who drank coffee.From this analysis, the key finding is that tea led to an increased production of interferon, which helps strengthen the body's defense system against infections.Thus, the correct answer to the question is:C. the body to produce more interferon The answer is C. the body to produce more interferon

Q: article:
            A subject which seems to have been insufficiently studied by doctors and psychologists is the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of mankind. There seems no doubt that the general character of the landscape, the relative length of day and night, and the climate must all play a big part in determining what kind of people we are.
It is true that a few studies have been made. Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply, or perhaps types of land that provide breeding places for pests like mosquitoes or rats.
Moreover, we can all generalize about types of people we have met. Those living in countries with long dark winters are apt to be less talkative and less vivacious than inhabitants of countries where the climate is more equable. And where the olive and the orange grow, there the inhabitants are cheerful, talkative, and spontaneous.
But these commonplace generalizations are inadequate: the influence of climate and geography should be studied in depth. Do all mountain dwellers live to a ripe old age? Does the drinking of wine, rather than beer, result in a sunny and open temperament? Is the strength and height of one of the Kenyan tribes due to their habitual drinking of the blood of cows?
We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies.
            question:
            _   might serve as a suitable title for this selection.
            options:
            ['A. The Importance of Geographical Environment', 'B. The Influence of Geographical Environment on Man', 'C. Generalization of Types of People', 'D. Geographical Environment, a Mysterious Subject']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine a suitable title for the article, let's review the main points and themes:1. The central theme of the article is the influence of geography and climate on both the psychological and physical health of humans. The author suggests that geography and climate have not been studied sufficiently in this context.2. The article mentions existing studies where specific geographical factors, such as the presence of certain minerals or ecological conditions, contribute to the health of the population in particular areas.3. Common stereotypes about people from different geographical regions are discussed but considered inadequate, highlighting the need for more in-depth research.4. The article poses questions about the potential influence of geographical and environmental conditions on human characteristics and aspirations for future studies.Given these points, let's evaluate each title option:- 'A. The Importance of Geographical Environment' - While geography is indeed discussed as important, the emphasis is on its influence on humans, making this option somewhat incomplete.  - 'B. The Influence of Geographical Environment on Man' - This option directly captures the main theme, focusing on how geography impacts human psychology and physical health.- 'C. Generalization of Types of People' - The article touches on generalizations, but the central theme is more about the influence of geography rather than the generalizations themselves The answer is 'B. The Influence of Geographical Environment on Man'. This option directly captures the main theme of the article, which is about the impact of geography and climate

Q: article:
            A subject which seems to have been insufficiently studied by doctors and psychologists is the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of mankind. There seems no doubt that the general character of the landscape, the relative length of day and night, and the climate must all play a big part in determining what kind of people we are.
It is true that a few studies have been made. Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply, or perhaps types of land that provide breeding places for pests like mosquitoes or rats.
Moreover, we can all generalize about types of people we have met. Those living in countries with long dark winters are apt to be less talkative and less vivacious than inhabitants of countries where the climate is more equable. And where the olive and the orange grow, there the inhabitants are cheerful, talkative, and spontaneous.
But these commonplace generalizations are inadequate: the influence of climate and geography should be studied in depth. Do all mountain dwellers live to a ripe old age? Does the drinking of wine, rather than beer, result in a sunny and open temperament? Is the strength and height of one of the Kenyan tribes due to their habitual drinking of the blood of cows?
We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies.
            question:
            Using context clues we may infer that " iodine, fluoride and calcium" are   _  .
            options:
            ["A. substances which act positively or negatively on man's health", 'B. harmful substances in the water supply', 'C. substances which help provide breeding places for pests', 'D. substances contributory to good health']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To solve this problem, we should analyze the provided article and the context in which "iodine, fluoride, and calcium" are mentioned.1. **Understanding the Context**: The article discusses the influence of geography and climate on health, mentioning that in areas with generally good or bad health, scientists have identified factors such as specific substances in the water supply.2. **Analyzing the Mentioned Substances**: The article lists "iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron" as examples of substances in the water supply that are linked to health outcomes. The presence or absence of these substances is highlighted as contributing factors to the health of the inhabitants.3. **Determining the Nature of the Substances**:    - **Positive or Negative Influence**: The sentence "scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron" suggests that these substances can have either a beneficial or detrimental effect on health, depending on their presence or absence.    - **General Health Implications**: Iodine, fluoride, and calcium are typically associated with health, influencing various conditions and health factors.4. **Conclusion**:   - Given this information, the most appropriate inference is that these substances act positively The answer is "A. substances which act positively or negatively on man's health".

Q: article:
            "Children who eat less salt and drink fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks may significantly lower their risks of obesity," researchers recently reported in the journal Hypertension.
"Sugar-sweetened soft drinks are a significant source of calorie intake in children," said Feng J. He, a researcher at St George's University of London, England. "It has been shown that sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption is related to obesity in young people." They wanted to know whether there is a link between salt intake and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption.
Dr He and colleagues analyzed data from a 1997 national survey of more than 2,000 people between 4 and 18 in Britain. "We found that children eating a lower-salt diet drank less fluid," said He. "From our research, we estimated that 1 gram of salt cut from their daily diet would reduce fluid intake by 100 grams per day."
The researchers also found that children eating a lower-salt diet drank fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks. From their research, they predicted that reducing salt intake by 1 gram each day would reduce sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption by 27 grams per day, after. "If children aged 4 to 18 cut their salt intake by half, there would be a decrease of about two sugar-sweetened soft drinks per week per child, so each child would decrease calorie intake by almost 250 kilocalories per week," Dr He said.
In previous studies, researchers found that a low-salt diet lowers blood pressure in children, and prevents the development of high blood pressure later in life. "Both high blood pressure and obesity increase the risk of having strokes and heart attacks," Dr He said.
Dr He recommends that parents check labels and choose low-salt food products. "Small reductions in the salt content of 10 to 20 percent cannot be detected by the human salt taste receptors   and do not cause any technological or safety problems," Dr He said.
            question:
            According to the passage, obesity is directly linked to   _  .
            options:
            ['A. high-salt foods', 'B. sugar-sweetened soft drinks', 'C. high blood pressure', 'D. strokes and heart attacks']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the answer, we need to examine the information provided in the article about the relationship between obesity and other factors.1. The article highlights the direct link between sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption and obesity, particularly in children. It states: "Sugar-sweetened soft drinks are a significant source of calorie intake in children," and "It has been shown that sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption is related to obesity in young people."2. The article does not state that high-salt foods directly lead to obesity. It discusses how reducing salt intake can decrease fluid consumption, including sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which are directly linked to obesity.3. High blood pressure is mentioned as a health issue that, like obesity, increases the risk of strokes and heart attacks, but the article does not suggest that high blood pressure is directly linked to obesity itself.4. Strokes and heart attacks are discussed as potential risks increased by both obesity and high blood pressure, rather than being direct causes of obesity.Therefore, the factor that is directly linked to obesity, according to the passage, is:B. sugar-sweetened soft drinks. The answer is B. sugar-sweetened soft drinks.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer the question, it's important to focus on what the recent study found that was different from previous studies. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of each option:1. **Option A**: "A lower-salt diet may mean less sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption."     - The recent study found a link between salt intake and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption. Specifically, it found that when children consumed less salt, they also consumed fewer sugar-sweetened drinks. This is a finding from the recent study that was not explicitly stated in previous studies, making it a distinct aspect of this research.2. **Option B**: "A low-salt diet keeps children out of high blood pressure."     - The effect of a low-salt diet on blood pressure was mentioned as a finding from previous studies, not as a new finding in the recent study.3. **Option C**: "Children face the risk of having strokes and heart attacks."     - The risk of strokes and heart attacks is linked to both high blood pressure and obesity, as noted in the text. However, this information is presented as background knowledge rather than something new found in the recent study.4. **Option D**: "Low-salt food products do The answer is A. a lower-salt diet may mean less sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine which statement Dr. He would agree with, let's examine the key points from the provided information and evaluate the options:1. Dr. He and the researchers found a link between lower salt intake and reduced sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption, which could lower the risk of obesity.2. They noted that earlier studies have shown a low-salt diet also helps lower blood pressure and can prevent high blood pressure development, which ties to reducing risks for strokes and heart attacks.3. Dr. He recommends choosing low-salt food products and suggests that small reductions in salt content would not be noticeable in taste nor would they cause safety issues.Now, let's evaluate the options:- Option A: "The less salt people eat, the healthier people become."  - Dr. He supports the idea that reducing salt is beneficial in terms of lowering risks of obesity and high blood pressure, which supports overall health. While this statement broadly captures the sentiment, it is not as specific as the key points she discusses and doesn't directly mention the connection to obesity and high blood pressure.- Option B: "Children should reduce fluid intake in their daily life."  - The research mentions that a lower-salt diet leads to reduced fluid intake, but the goal isn't to reduce fluid intake arbitrarily The answer is D. A low-salt diet may prevent both high blood pressure and obesity.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine who should take effective action based on the article, let's analyze the roles and recommendations provided:1. The study discussed in the article involves children and their consumption habits related to salt and sugar-sweetened soft drinks. However, children are not directly responsible for managing their dietary habits.2. The article highlights Dr. He's recommendation for parents to check labels and choose low-salt food products for their children. This suggests that parents play a crucial role in managing and controlling the dietary habits of their children. They are in a position to make healthier food choices and reduce salt and sugar intake in their child's diet.3. Doctors and researchers, while conducting studies and providing health guidelines, are not the ones who directly implement dietary changes in children's daily lives. They offer insights and recommendations but the actionable steps are typically carried out by parents.4. Therefore, the responsibility and ability to take effective action regarding dietary changes falls on the parents.Considering these points, the most appropriate answer is:B. Parents. The answer is B. Parents.

Q: article:
            Like every language, American English is full of special expressions, phrases that come from the day-to-day life of the people and develop in their own way.
Our expression today is "to face the music". When someone says, "Well, I guess I'll have to face the music," it does not mean he's planning to go to the concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you didn't do this or that. Awful music indeed, but it has to be faced. At sometime or another, every one of us has to face the music, especially as children. We can all remember father's angry voice, "I want to talk to you." and only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was!
The phrase "to face the music" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. And where did this expression come from? The first explanation comes from the American novelist, James Fenimore Looper. He said, in 1851, that the expression was first used by actors while waiting to go on the stage. When they got their cue  to go on, they often said, "Well, it's time to face the music." And that was exactly what they did--facing the orchestra  which was just below them. And an actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of an audience that might be friendly or perhaps _ , especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. If he did not, there would be no play. So the expression "to face the music" came to mean "having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice."
Other explanations about the expression go back to the army. When the men faced an inspection  by their leader, the soldiers would be worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean, shiny enough to pass the inspection? Still the men had to go out and face the music of the band as well as the inspection. What else could they do?
Another army explanation is more closely linked to the idea of facing the results and accepting the responsibility for something that should not have been done. For example, when a man is forced out of the army because he did something terrible, he is dishonored. The band does not play. Only the drums tap a sad, slow beat. The soldier is forced to leave, facing such music as it is and facing the back of his horse.
            question:
            How many ways does the phrase "to face the music" comes from?
            options:
            ['A. 1.', 'B. 2.', 'C. 3.', 'D. 4.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
The article provides three different explanations for the origin of the phrase "to face the music":1. **Actors' Explanation**: Actors used the phrase when they went on stage and faced the orchestra, indicating they were facing the audience and the performance, regardless of how they felt.2. **Army Inspection Explanation**: Soldiers facing an inspection, worried about their appearance and equipment, but having no choice but to face the band and the inspection.3. **Dishonorable Discharge Explanation**: A soldier being forced out of the army due to dishonorable conduct. In this context, facing the music is related to accepting the consequences, symbolized by the drums' beat as the soldier faces away from the army.Hence, there are three explanations provided. The correct answer is:C. 3. The answer is C. 3.

Another army explanation is more closely linked to the idea of facing the results and accepting the responsibility for something that should not have been done. For example, when a man is forced out of the army because he did something terrible, he is dishonored. The band does not play. Only the drums tap a sad, slow beat. The soldier is forced to leave, facing such music as it is and facing the back of his horse.
            question:
            What's the meaning of "to face the music"?
            options:
            ['A. To face something far less pleasant.', 'B. To face the stage.', "C. To face the back of one's horse.", "D. To face one's leader."]
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the meaning of the phrase "to face the music," let's analyze the context provided in the article:1. **Description of the Phrase**: The article describes "to face the music" as going through an unpleasant experience, knowing that it is unavoidable. This introduction directly points to facing something undesired or uncomfortable.2. **Theatre Origin Explanation**:   - Actors were said to be waiting to go on stage, and they had to "face the music" (the orchestra) as they stepped into view of the audience. This scenario implies a sense of nervousness or discomfort, but also inevitability, because without facing it, the show could not proceed.3. **Military Origin Explanation**:   - Soldiers had to "face the music" during inspections, concerned about looking perfect and having their equipment in proper order. Again, it highlights a situation that might be stressful or unpleasant but necessary.   - The other military scenario involves a dishonored soldier who must leave the army, accompanied by a sad drumming rather than celebratory music. This underscores the idea of facing the consequences of one's actions, which is unpleasant.Given the overall context of these examples, the meaning of "to face the music" is most closely related to Option A: "to The answer is A. To face something far less pleasant.

Q: article:
            Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man.
What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread."
To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.
            question:
            We learn from the passage that the author   _  .
            options:
            ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To answer the question, let's analyze the passage and evaluate each option:1. **A. was a wealthy person in the community**   - The passage does not provide specific information about the author's own wealth or status in the community. The focus is more on the observations made by the author about other men who were once wealthy and successful.2. **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**   - The author reflects on the idea that having a purpose and staying productive is important for happiness. He references a passage from Genesis and the words of St. Paul, suggesting that challenges and maintaining faith are crucial for life. This indicates that the author values an active, purpose-driven life instead of the complacency observed in the men in the locker room.3. **C. was fond of associating with celebrities**   - There is no mention in the passage of the author associating with celebrities or expressing a fondness for such associations. The passage is focused on the author's reflections and observations rather than personal associations with celebrities.4. **D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed**   - The passage discusses openly what impressed the author—the biblical passage about "the sweat of the face shall you eat bread" and the inspiration from St. The answer is 'B. held a positive attitude towards an active life'.

            options:
            ['A. To use wealth properly,eat,drink and be merry.', 'B. Where there is a will,there is a wav.', 'C. As life is but like a dream,a man is like a fruit tree.', 'D. If you cease to struggle,you cease to live.']
        
A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To analyze the passage and determine what is implied by the writer, let's break down the key elements:1. The passage discusses two challenging aspects: acquiring wealth through honest effort and using it properly.2. The writer reflects on a scene at a golf club where affluent men, once successful and respected, appear to lack happiness despite their material wealth.3. The author implies that these men are using alcohol as a means to escape reality because their sense of productivity and purpose has ended.4. The writer quotes a passage from Genesis and St. Paul, suggesting that continuous effort and struggle are essential to life and happiness.5. The phrase "In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread" is interpreted as a lifelong challenge that equates to staying productive and purposeful.Based on the above points, Option D "If you cease to struggle, you cease to live" is most aligned with the writer's implication. The passage emphasizes that ongoing effort, struggle, and maintaining a sense of purpose are crucial for a long and happy existence. The other options do not align with the central theme presented in the passage. The answer is D. If you cease to struggle, you cease to live.

A: Let's think step by step.
Reasoning Chain Output:
To determine the best title for the passage, we need to analyze the content and purpose of the article. The passage provides information about various organized trips in the Blue Mountains area, focusing on nature walks and exploration opportunities with specific themes like black bear counting, bird watching, and night wildlife observation.1. **Option A: Adventure Travel in America**   - The article is specifically about trips in the Blue Mountains area and not about adventure travel across America. So, this title is too broad and not specific to the content.2. **Option B: Hunting around the Great Mountains**   - The activities mentioned in the passage do not involve hunting. Instead, they focus on wildlife observation and nature walks. Therefore, this title is misleading.3. **Option C: Discovery Trips in the Blue Mountains**   - This option accurately reflects the nature of the trips described. The activities are exploratory ("discovery") in nature, and they are located in the Blue Mountains.4. **Option D: Interesting Trips in the East of the USA**   - While the trips may indeed be interesting, they are specifically located in the Blue Mountains. The passage does not mention anything about their relevance to the broader "East of the USA," making this title less precise.Given these considerations, the The answer is Option C: Discovery Trips in the Blue Mountains.
