Q: article:             Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had. Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out. "Surgery ," one replied. I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job . One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!" At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall! It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality. No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.             question:             We can know from the passage that the author works as a_.             options:             ['A. doctor', 'B. model', 'C. teacher', 'D. reporter']

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we should examine the context of the provided article. The main topic of discussion revolves around students who are considering cosmetic surgery to enhance their job prospects after graduation. The article specifically mentions a conversation about students believing they need "outside help" to secure the jobs they desire and that some are considering surgery as a means to get ahead in the job market.
The article includes a specific example of a student contemplating leg-lengthening surgery to become taller, citing the belief that physical appearance can impact job opportunities. The author expresses concern about this trend, highlighting how the media and advertisements promote an unattainable ideal of "perfection."
Considering this context, the key reason many graduates today might turn to cosmetic surgery is to gain an edge in job-hunting. They believe that improving their physical appearance will give them an advantage over others competing for the same positions.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: Marry a better man/woman – The article does not mention relationships or marrying as a motivation for surgery.
- Option B: Become a model – The focus is not on modeling but rather on general job prospects after graduation.
- Option C: Get an advantage over others in job-hunting – This directly aligns with the theme of the article, where students
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'C. get an advantage over others in job-hunting'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the answer, let's analyze the passage and the options given:
1. **Understanding the author's opinion**:
   - The author discusses the worrying trend of graduates believing they need "outside help" like surgery to improve job prospects.
   - The author is surprised and alarmed by this belief, particularly by the extreme measures like surgery to increase height.
   - The author expresses shock at the lengths people would go for "perfection" and criticizes the media's portrayal of perfect people.
   - The author suggests that skills, rather than appearance, should matter more in a career.
2. **Examining the options**:

   - **B**: "it's right for graduates to ask for others to help them out in hunting for jobs" - This is not addressed directly in terms of being right or wrong; the focus is rather on the obsession with appearance.
   - **C**: "it is one's appearance instead of skills that really matters in one's career" - The author disagrees with this, stating that skills should determine success rather than appearance.
   - **
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. The author believes that media are to blame for misleading young people in their seeking for surgery.

A: Let's think step by step.

   - The author expresses concern about the trend towards seeking physical "perfection" due to societal pressures.
   - The emphasis on appearance versus skills in job success is critiqued.
3. **Title options analysis**:
   - **A. Young Graduates Have Higher Expectations**: This title is too vague and doesn't capture the specific focus on surgery and job prospects.
   - **B. Young Graduates Look to Surgery for Better Jobs**: This title directly addresses the main issue discussed in the passage—graduates considering surgery for job market benefits.
   - **C. Young Graduates' Opinion About Cosmetic Surgery**: While relevant, the passage is less about opinions on surgery itself and more about the reasons behind contemplating it for career enhancement.
   - **D. Young Graduates Face a Different Situation in Job-hunting
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. Young Graduates Look to Surgery for Better Jobs

Q: article:             YUZHOU, HENAN -An accident in a central China coal mine killed 21 miners Saturday and left another 16 trapped underground , the government said. The death rose to 26 Sunday morning as rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners who were still trapped underground, rescue headquarters said. Rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners still trapped underground, but chances for them to survive were very slim, said Du Bo, deputy chief of the rescue headquarters. "Based upon past experience, the remaining 11 miners could be buried in coal dust, so the survival chances are frail," Du said. More than 2,500 tons of coal dust smothered  the pit after the gas leak , which hampered  the rescue, said Du. The gas outburst happened at 6:03 a.m. Saturday when 276 miners were working underground in the mine in Yuzhou City. A total of 239 workers escaped but 21 were found dead and 16 trapped. An initial  investigation showed that 173,500 cubic meters of gas leaked out in the accident. Liu Wenbin, a deputy chief engineer of the company that owns the mine, was in the pit  when the accident happened. He organized the escape. "At around 6 a.m., I felt there was something wrong with the airflow in the shaft, and one of the team captains told me he also felt it and had already reported the problem," said Liu The mine is owned by Pingyu Coal & Electric Co. Ltd., a company jointly established by four investors, including Zhong Ping Energy Chemical Group and China Power Investment Corp.             question:             What could be the best title for this passage?             options:             ['A. Death Toll Rises in an Accident in China', 'B. A Coal Mine Accident in Central China', 'C. An Accident in Central China', 'D. Coal Mine Accidents in China']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, we need to consider the main focus and key details provided in the article.
1. The passage primarily discusses a coal mine accident in central China.
2. It provides specific details about the location (Yuzhou City, Henan Province), the number of miners killed and trapped, and rescue efforts.
3. The passage reports on the initial death toll and updates it as rescuers continue to search for the trapped miners.
4. The article also mentions the cause of the accident, a gas outburst, and the challenges faced during the rescue operations.
Now, let's evaluate each of the provided options:
- Option A: "Death Toll Rises in an Accident in China" – This focuses on the increasing death toll, which is an important aspect of the article. However, it lacks specificity about the nature of the accident and location.
- Option B: "A Coal Mine Accident in Central China" – This option accurately represents the main event of the passage, identifying the type of accident (coal mine) and the region (central China). It's specific and covers the primary focus of the article.
- Option C: "An Accident in Central China" – This is too vague, as it doesn't specify the type of accident, which is

Of the 276 miners in the mine only 21 were dead until the next morning', 'B. The miners trapped underground would be saved without difficulty', 'C. 16 miners trapped underground were still found alive waiting for the rescue', 'D. Until the next morning another 5 miners were found dead in this accident']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage regarding the incident at the coal mine.
1. The passage states that initially, 21 miners were reported dead. By Sunday morning, the death toll had risen to 26.
2. This indicates that an additional 5 miners were found dead by the next morning, which aligns with option D.
3. Furthermore, the passage mentions that rescuers were trying to reach 11 miners who were still trapped underground, but the survival chances were considered "very slim."
4. The passage does not state that 16 miners were found alive; instead, it mentions that there were 16 trapped after the initial incident, with efforts focused on reaching the surviving 11.
5. Regarding the escape, 239 out of 276 miners managed to escape after the gas leak.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: "Of the 276 miners in the mine only 21 were dead until the next morning" is not entirely accurate because by the next morning, the reported death toll increased to 26.
  
- Option B: "The miners trapped underground would be saved without difficulty" is incorrect as the survival chances were noted to be very slim.
- Option C: "16 miners trapped underground
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. Until the next morning another 5 miners were found dead in this accident

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is not true according to the article, let's evaluate each option:
- **Option A**: "The mine was owned by more than one company."
  - The article states, "The mine is owned by Pingyu Coal & Electric Co.

This indicates that the mine was indeed owned by more than one company, making this statement true.
- **Option B**: "There was at least one more similar accident happening in Central China before."
  - The article does not mention any previous accidents or provide information about similar incidents occurring in Central China. Therefore, there is no basis in the text to confirm this statement, making it not true based on the provided information.

A: Let's think step by step.
The article discusses the process of making career choices and managing your career, emphasizing that it is a lifelong process. However, it doesn't explicitly list distinct "tips" or steps in a numbered manner. Instead, it highlights several important considerations and strategies for effective career management, such as understanding your interests, abilities, values, using career resources, and combining self-knowledge with labor market research. These pieces of advice are woven throughout the text rather than being listed as discrete tips. Therefore, the answer is not clearly presented in a numbered format.
It's important to assess the article for any clear enumeration of tips. Since there's no explicit count provided and the advice is descriptive rather than prescriptive in clear steps, the number of tips is not stated. The options given do not accurately capture the nature of the article, as it doesn't specify a set number of tips.
Therefore, interpreting the text for the most appropriate response:
D. 4. (There are various aspects mentioned, neither distinctly enumerated nor clearly limited to a specific number of "tips.")
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

Q: article:             Understanding the process of making career choices and managing your career is a basic life skill that everyone should understand. Your career decisions have such a profound effect on all aspects of your life. It's important to have the knowledge and resources needed to make smart, informed decisions. Whether you are looking for a new job, aiming to take the next step at your current job or planning your retirement options, you are making career decisions. Using good resources and the guidance of a career counselor can help you to make those decisions well. Many people mistakenly believe that choosing a career is a one-time event that happens some time in early adulthood. However, career management is actually a life-long process, and we continue to make consequential   career choices over the years. When people want to take action in their career, career management and job search are about so much more than writing a good resume. If you learn about and act on the following areas of career management, you'll be rewarded throughout your career. Your interests, abilities, values, personal needs and realities should all be taken into account in any career decision making process. You spend countless hours at work, and it impacts your life in so many ways; it makes sense that you should be fully informed before making such profound decisions. Do you know how many different career choices are available to you? Both The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (American) and The National Occupational Classification (Canadian) list well over 20,000 different job titles. So unless you've actively explored a variety of career options, there's a very good chance that there are great possibilities available to you, and you don't even realize they exist. Match your understanding of yourself with your understanding of possible career options. Once you have developed a good understanding of yourself, you will be able to combine that self-knowledge with your career and labor market research to determine potential careers that are a great fit for you. When you've made a well informed decision, then you're ready to make it happen. Making use of good career guidance and resources will help you to acquire the education, skills, and experience needed to get the job and learn and implement   effective job search strategies. Time spent understanding your needs, researching your career options and developing outstanding job search skills, guided by great career resources, is a powerful investment in your future.             question:             It can be inferred that   _  .             options:             ["A. career decision is misunderstood by many people because they don't take it as a life-long process", 'B. your career will be definitely successful if you make a well informed decision', 'C. making yourself understood can help you make a final choice', 'D. writing a good resume can find a good job']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we'll analyze the provided article to identify which inference aligns best with its content. Let's evaluate each option in context:
1. **Option A**: "career decision is misunderstood by many people because they don't take it as a life-long process"
   - The article clearly emphasizes that many people wrongly think choosing a career is a one-time event in early adulthood, whereas it states that career management is, in fact, a lifelong process. Thus, this option is strongly supported by the article.
2. **Option B**: "your career will be definitely successful if you make a well informed decision"
   - While the article underscores the importance of making well-informed decisions, it does not guarantee success. There is no claim made that simply making informed decisions will definitely lead to success.
3. **Option C**: "making yourself understood can help you make a final choice"
   - The article discusses understanding oneself in the context of making suitable career choices, but it does not imply making oneself understood by others plays a role in making a career decision.
4. **Option D**: "writing a good resume can find a good job"
   - The article specifically states that career management is about much more than just writing a good resume, suggesting that a resume

Q: article:             Astronauts on shorter shuttle missions often work very long days.  Tasks are scheduled so tightly that break times are often used to finish the day's work.  This type of schedule is far too demanding for long missions on the International  Space Station(ISS). ISS crewmembers usually live in space for at least a quarter of a year. They work five days on and two days off to _ the normal way they do things on Earth as much as possible. Weekends give the crew valuable time to rest and do a few hours of housework. They can communicate with family and friends by email , internet phone and through private video conferences. While astronauts cannot go to a baseball game or a movie in orbit, there are many familiar activities that they can still enjoy . Before a mission, the family and friends of each ISS crewmember put together a collection of family photos, messages, videos and reading material for the astronauts to look at when they will be floating 370 kilometers above the Earth. During their mission, the crew also receives care packages with CDs, books, magazines, photos and letters . And as from early 2010, the internet became available on the ISS , giving astronauts the chance to do some "web surfing "in their personal time. Besides relaxing with these more common entertainments, astronauts can simply enjoy the experience of living in space. Many astronauts say that one of the most relaxing things to do in space is to look out the window and stare at the universe and the Earth's vast land mass and oceans.             question:             Which of the following best describes the families of the astronauts on the ISS ?             options:             ['A. They are caring and thoughtful.', 'B. They are worried and upset.', 'C. They are impatient and annoyed.', 'D. They are excited and curious.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option best describes the families of the astronauts on the ISS, we should consider the information given in the article about the interactions and actions taken by the families.
1. The article mentions that "the family and friends of each ISS crewmember put together a collection of family photos, messages, videos and reading material for the astronauts to look at." This suggests that the families are doing something considerate and supportive for the astronauts, which indicates care and thoughtfulness.
2. It also mentions that during the astronauts' mission, the crew receives care packages with items like CDs, books, magazines, photos, and letters. The effort of sending these packages is another indication of care and support.
3. There is nothing in the article that suggests the families are worried, upset, impatient, annoyed, excited, or curious. The focus is instead on how families help create a supportive and comforting environment for the astronauts through their thoughtful actions.
Based on this information, the most appropriate option is:
A. They are caring and thoughtful.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A.

A: Let's think step by step.
The passage is about the daily life of astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS), particularly focusing on how they spend their time and manage work during their missions. Let's break down the main points:
1. **Work Schedule**: The article starts by explaining how demanding the work schedule is for astronauts on short-term shuttle missions. It contrasts these with the schedules for crew members on longer missions aboard the ISS, who work five days and have two days off each week to mimic normal terrestrial routines as closely as possible.
2. **Rest and Communication**: The article highlights that the weekends give the crew time to rest and handle personal affairs. It specifically mentions communication with family and friends via email, internet phone, and video conferences.
3. **Entertainment and Relaxation**: The passage then discusses various activities astronauts can do for leisure. These activities include receiving care packages, accessing the internet, and enjoying familiar forms of entertainment. A significant part of this relaxation also involves appreciating the unique experiences of space, such as looking out the window to view the Earth and space.
Given these points, the passage reveals various ways astronauts manage their personal and leisure time while on long missions in space, rather than focusing primarily on their work or communication methods. 
Hence, the passage mainly discusses how astronauts spend

Q: article:             Dogs have long been used to find explosives and drugs.Now,a new study shows that man's best friend can also help to find lung and breast cancer,researchers report in integrative Cancer Therapies.The findings show that trained ordinary household dogs can detect early--stage lung and breast cancers by smelling the breath samples of patients. Researchers have found that cancer cells send out molecules different from those of healthy ones,and that might be sensed by smell by the highly sensitive dog's nose. For the study,five dogs were trained by a professional instructor to respond differently to breath samples of healthy and cancer patients."The dogs learned to sit or lie down in front of cancer patient samples and to ignore control samples through the method of food reward," McCulloch explained. After a period of training,researchers tested the animals'ability to distinguish cancer patients from controls.The animals were given breath samples from 55 patients with lung cancer,3 1 with breast cancer and 83 healthy controls who were not included in the original training period. McCulloch's group found that the dogs were able to correctly distinguish the breath samples of cancer patients from those of the control subjects in about 90 percent of the cases.The dogs were also able to detecting early-stage lung and breast cancers. "These results show that there is hope for early detection,"McCulloch said.The re-searches are planning to conduct further studies on the breath composition of cancer patients to possibly design an electronic device that can do the dogs'job."A dog's nose is so powerful it can detect odors 10 000 to 100 000 times better than a human nose can.I hope people will be interested in doing this research,"McCulloch added,"It shows that there is definitely something out there."             question:             McCulloch and his group used_in their research.             options:             ['A. 10 dogs and 55 people', 'B. 5 dogs and 86 people', 'C. 10 dogs and 83 people', 'D. 5 dogs and 169 people']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to find out how many dogs and people McCulloch and his group used in their research.
1. **Number of Dogs:** The article clearly states that "five dogs were trained by a professional instructor." Therefore, the number of dogs is 5.
2. **Number of People:** 
   - The study involved testing breath samples from:
     - 55 patients with lung cancer
     - 31 patients with breast cancer
     - 83 healthy controls
   To find the total number of people, we add these numbers together: 
   \(55 + 31 + 83 = 169\).
From the information above, McCulloch and his group used 5 dogs and 169 people in their research.
The correct option from the given choices is:
- D. 5 dogs and 169 people

A: Let's think step by step.
To infer from the passage, we need to carefully assess the information provided and consider the implications beyond what is directly stated.
1. **Option A:** The passage specifically discusses lung and breast cancer. While it mentions that dogs can detect these cancers, it does not provide any information about dogs detecting other types of cancer. Therefore, option A cannot be inferred from the passage.
2. **Option B:** The passage does discuss the potential of designing an electronic device for cancer detection, based on the results and further studies on breath composition. This suggests that the ultimate aim of the research is indeed to create a technological solution, which aligns with the idea of an "electronic dog," although the focus is on an electronic device. Option B seems to be a reasonable inference, as the researchers are contemplating the development of such a device.
3. **Option C:** The passage explicitly states, "A dog's nose is so powerful it can detect odors 10,000 to 100,000 times better than a human nose can." This is a factual statement within the passage, not an inference based on other information.
4. **Option D:** While the dogs' ability to detect cancer is promising, the passage does not suggest that they will "soon be widely used" in hospitals. The
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. The final goal of the researchers is to design an electronic dog to detect cancer.

Special Noses of Dogs', 'B. Dogs and Cancer', 'C. Dogs Smell Signs of Cancer', "D. McCulloch'S New Discovery"]
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the article, we need to focus on the main idea and purpose of the article.
1. **Main Idea:** The article discusses a study in which dogs were trained to detect early-stage lung and breast cancer by smelling patients' breath samples. The findings suggest that dogs can effectively differentiate between cancer patients and healthy individuals based on smell, highlighting the potential for early cancer detection through olfactory means.
2. **Purpose:** The study's purpose is to investigate and demonstrate the ability of dogs to detect cancer using their highly sensitive sense of smell. The study aims to show that trained dogs can identify cancer with high accuracy and the possibility of developing an electronic device for early cancer detection in the future.
3. **Review Options:**
   - **A. Special Noses of Dogs:** This title emphasizes the unique ability of dogs' noses but does not specifically relate it to cancer detection.
   - **B. Dogs and Cancer:** This is a broad title that covers the general relationship between dogs and cancer but lacks specificity regarding the study's findings.
   - **C. Dogs Smell Signs of Cancer:** This title directly addresses the study's findings, highlighting the ability of dogs to detect cancer through smell. It captures the essence of the article, focusing on the

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to consider the details provided about the Sibshops program and the explicit goals it aims to achieve. According to the article:
1. **Sibshops**: This program targets siblings of children with challenges. 
2. **Focus**: It centers on group activities and discussion methods aimed at enhancing sibling relationships and boosting family happiness as a whole.
Now, let's evaluate each of the options:
- **A. Meet with other peers**: While Sibshops does involve participating in group activities, the article specifically highlights its goal, which goes beyond just meeting other peers. Thus, this option is not the primary focus of the Sibshops program.
  
- **B. Solve your mental problem**: The program does not mention solving mental problems. It focuses on relationships and family happiness, not on individual mental health issues.
  
- **C. Improve sibling relationships**: The article explicitly states that one of the main purposes of Sibshops is to focus on improving sibling relationships. Therefore, this option directly aligns with the program's objectives.
  
- **D. Think of healthy coping skills**: This option is mentioned in the description of the Banana Splits program, not Sibshops. Therefore, it does not pertain specifically to Sibshops.
Thus
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. Improve sibling relationships

Q: article:             Every time I lost a tooth I would put it under my pillow at night. The next morning I would wake up to find two coins replacing my tooth. Then I'd wonder about the tooth fairy all day. "Mom, where do you think the tooth fairy lives? What does she do with the teeth she collects?" My mom said she didn't know. She only knew that the tooth fairy took the tooth away while we were sleeping and left us some money under our pillow. But I wanted to find out. So I think it was a good thing that I would lose another tooth. The plan was to stay up all night and ask the tooth fairy when she showed up. That night I lay quietly in my bed, growing sleepy as the night went on. Moments later, I felt that someone was close to me. Through my half-opened eyes, I didn't see any feet, but I knew it was the tooth fairy. I watched her run around and fly right out of my room. She was wearing a shiny green dress. After she left, I immediately felt under my pillow. There were two coins. I had never even felt my pillow move. I wondered if she used magic. As I got older, I learned from my teachers that the tooth fairy didn't exist. It was just a mythical figure of early childhood. I kind of thought it was, but how could I see the tooth fairy fly that night? Then one night my mom came into my room to check on me. The moonlight was bright that night and it shone through my window right on her shiny green nightdress. Right then I knew deep down that my mom was the tooth fairy.             question:             As a young girl, the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was afraid of the tooth fairy', 'B. was interested in the tooth fairy', 'C. knew where the tooth fairy lived', 'D. doubted if the tooth fairy existed']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option about the author's feelings as a young girl, we need to analyze the passage provided carefully.
1. When the author was young, she would place lost teeth under her pillow and in the morning find coins. She would then "wonder about the tooth fairy all day" and ask her mom questions about where the tooth fairy lived and what she did with the teeth. This indicates curiosity and fascination.
2. Her mother would tell her she didn’t know much about the tooth fairy, just that it took the teeth and left money.
3. The author wanted to find out more and even planned to stay awake to meet the tooth fairy, suggesting she was interested in learning more about this figure from her childhood.
4. As a child, she perceived seeing the tooth fairy (or her mom dressed similarly) in her room one night, which enthralled her even more. This shows a deep interest, not fear or immediate skepticism.
5. It is only when she got older and learned from her teachers that the tooth fairy was a mythical figure that the notion of it not being real sunk in, along with identifying her mom as playing the role.
From these points, it is clear that the author's primary feeling towards the tooth fairy as a young girl was one of interest
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to understand the author's motivation for wanting to lose another tooth. The article describes the author's curiosity about the tooth fairy and her desire to find out more about her. Specifically, the author has a plan to stay up all night and ask the tooth fairy questions when she shows up.
Let's examine each of the options:
- Option A: "she could get some coins" - While receiving coins is a consequence of losing a tooth, it's not the primary reason the author thought it was a good thing to lose another tooth. The focus in the narrative is more on the curiosity about the tooth fairy rather than the coins themselves.
- Option B: "she disliked her baby teeth" - There is no mention in the article of the author disliking her baby teeth or losing them for that reason.
- Option C: "she wanted to help her mother solve a mystery" - The article doesn't suggest that the mother is involved in solving a mystery. Rather, it is the author's personal curiosity driving the desire.
- Option D: "she believed the tooth fairy would come again" - This aligns with the author's plan to lose another tooth and stay up to see the tooth fairy. The author's goal is to satisfy her curiosity about the tooth fairy by hoping for
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. she believed the tooth fairy would come again

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's break down the relevant part of the article:
1. The author describes a plan to stay awake all night to see the tooth fairy.
2. As the night goes on, she becomes sleepy.
3. Moments later, she feels that someone is close to her.
4. She notes that her eyes are "half-opened" and mentions seeing no feet but assumes it's the tooth fairy.
Given these details, she is described as "growing sleepy" and having "half-opened eyes," which indicates a state of partial consciousness or being only half awake.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- A. thought her mother had come: This is not supported by the passage at that moment. She believes it's the tooth fairy, not her mother.
- B. believed she was in a dream: The text does not mention anything about her thinking she is dreaming.
- C. was only half awake: This accurately describes her state, as indicated by her "half-opened eyes."
- D. was unable to sleep: The article suggests she was getting sleepy, so this is not accurate.
Thus, the correct answer is C. was only half awake.

Q: article:             One day an old woman was traveling alone in the mountains. Suddenly she saw something shining  in the stream. When she came close, she found it was a precious  stone. She put the stone into her bag and went on with her trip. The next day the old woman met a young man, who was also a traveler in the mountains. The young man looked very hungry, so the old woman opened her bag to share her food. The hungry traveler saw the precious stone and asked carefully, "The stone is beautiful. Would you like to give it to me?" "Sure. Why not?" the woman said, and handed the stone to him. The young man left happily with the stone. He knew it was worth enough to give him _ for a lifetime. But a few days later he came back to return the stone to the woman. "I've been thinking," he said. "I know how valuable the stone is, but I give it back and hope that you can give me something even more precious. Give me what you have within your bag." The woman opened her bag. It was almost empty. She looked at the young man and smiled, "I have nothing special in my bag, but I do have something precious -- the joy of giving!" The young man felt ashamed  and left silently.             question:             How did the young man find the precious stone?             options:             ['A. He found it in his food.', 'B. He dug it out in a valley.', "C. He saw it in the woman's bag.", 'D. He noticed it shining in the stream.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how the young man found the precious stone, let's revisit key details from the article:
1. The article describes an old woman who found a precious stone in a stream while she was traveling alone in the mountains. She decided to keep the stone in her bag.
2. Later, the woman met a young man who appeared to be very hungry. She opened her bag to share her food with him.
3. It was at this point, when the woman opened her bag, that the young man saw the precious stone and asked if she would give it to him.
From these details, we can conclude that the young man saw the precious stone in the woman's bag when she opened it to share her food with him. Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. He saw it in the woman's bag.

Q: article:             One day an old woman was traveling alone in the mountains. Suddenly she saw something shining  in the stream. When she came close, she found it was a precious  stone.

A: Let's think step by step.
The story describes an encounter between an old woman and a young traveler. Initially, the young man is pleased to receive the precious stone, recognizing its value in providing for him financially. However, he later returns the stone to the old woman. 
The key moment in the story is when the young man returns and says, "I know how valuable the stone is, but I give it back and hope that you can give me something even more precious." This indicates his desire for something more precious than the stone itself, which brings us to the crux of his change in perspective.
The woman then shares that she possesses the "joy of giving," which suggests a deeper understanding of value beyond material wealth. The young man's actions suggest a realization or understanding, possibly of intangible concepts such as generosity or kindness.
Now, let's review the options:
- A. He found the stone was not precious: This is incorrect, as the story repeatedly confirms the stone's material value.
- B. He understood the real meaning of joy: This aligns with the story's theme about the joy of giving, suggesting a deeper understanding.
- C. He felt embarrassed at taking away the stone: While it's possible he felt some embarrassment, the story focuses more on the realization rather than embarrassment alone.
- D
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. He understood the real meaning of joy.

A special stone', 'B. The joy of giving', 'C. A woman and a young man', 'D. An experience in the mountains']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, we should consider the main theme and message conveyed by the story.
1. **Summary of the Passage:**
   - An old woman finds a precious stone while traveling in the mountains.
   - She meets a hungry young man and shares her food with him.
   - The young man sees the precious stone and asks for it; the woman willingly gives it to him.
   - The young man later returns the stone, asking for something more precious.
   - The woman shares her perspective that the true treasure is the joy of giving.
2. **Analyze the Options:**
   - **Option A: "A special stone"** - While the stone is a key element of the story, the focus is not solely on the stone itself, but rather on the act of giving it away.
   - **Option B: "The joy of giving"** - This option reflects the main theme and moral of the story, which is that the joy of selflessly giving to others is more valuable than material possessions.
   - **Option C: "A woman and a young man"** - This option mentions two main characters but does not encapsulate the central theme.
   - **Option D: "An experience in the mountains"
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'B. The joy of giving'

Q: article:             The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like "I never do anything right" into positive ones like "I can succeed." But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing   older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, "I am lovable." Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation  . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy   that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation   techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking.             question:             According to the study of the Canadian researchers,   _  .             options:             ['A. positive thinking is not as powerful as negative thinking', 'B. encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people', "C. happy people can think positively while unhappy people can't", 'D. getting people to think positively can strengthen their confidence']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's analyze the information provided in the article and relate it to the options given.
1. The article discusses a study conducted by researchers in Canada, which points out that encouraging people to think positively might not always work the way it is intended. Specifically, the study indicates that trying to force positive thoughts on individuals, especially those with low self-esteem, could actually emphasize their existing unhappiness.
2. The study involved participants with varying self-esteem levels who were asked to engage in self-affirmations. The results showed that instead of promoting positivity, the forced self-affirmations made those with low self-esteem feel worse, indicating a negative impact contrary to the desired effect.
3. The article highlights how positive thinking can backfire by highlighting people's awareness of their discontent. Instead of imposing positivity, the researchers suggest methods like meditation that allow a more balanced and accepting view of both positive and negative thoughts.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A** suggests a comparison of power between positive and negative thinking. The article doesn’t claim that negative thinking is more powerful but rather suggests that forced positive thinking can have adverse effects on some people.
- **Option B** aligns with the findings in the article. It reflects the idea that encouraging positive thinking might lead
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people

Q: article:             She was 6 years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live. She insisted on talking to me. "I'm building," she said. "I see that. What is it?" I asked, not caring. "Oh, I don't know, I just like the feel of sand." That sounds good, I thought, and slipped off my shoes. A sandpiper   glided by. "My mom says sandpipers come to bring us joy." "Good-bye joy," I muttered   to myself, "Hello pain," and turned to walk on. I was depressed; my life seemed completely out of balance. "What's your name?" She wouldn't give up. "Robert," I answered. "Mine's Wendy... I'm 6. Why are you so quiet?" I turned to her and shouted: "Because my mother died!" "Oh," she said quietly, "then this is a bad day." "Yes," I said, "and yesterday and the day before and - oh, go away!" "Did it hurt?" she asked. "Did what hurt?" I was annoyed with her, with myself. "When she died?" "Of course it hurt!" I replied angrily, misunderstanding. A month after that, when I next went to the beach, she wasn't there. Feeling guilty, ashamed, I went up to the cottage and knocked at the door. A young woman answered. "Hello," I said. "I'm Robert Peterson. I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was." "Wendy died last week, Mr. Peterson. She had leukemia . Maybe she didn't tell you." I had to catch my breath, saying nothing. "She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days. But the last few weeks, she declined rapidly... "She left something for you... if only I could find it," she said. "Could you wait a moment while I look?" It was a drawing in bright color1s- a yellow beach, a blue sea, and a brown bird. Underneath was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY. I took Wendy's mother in my arms. "I'm so sorry," I muttered over and over, and we wept together. But then we looked at the picture of the sandpiper and slowly both of us began to smile, remembering the lesson that Wendy had left us. Even when life seems sad, joy can be found in the smallest of things. We should take time to seek out these little joys in life and live for the love that we have for each other.             question:             When he talked to Wendy, the author failed to understand that   _  .             options:             ['A.

1. **Meeting Wendy**: The author meets Wendy, a young girl, on the beach. Wendy talks about sandpipers bringing joy, indicating her perception of finding happiness in simple things.
2. **The Author's Reaction**: At this point, the author is grappling with his own grief from losing his mother and projects his pain onto the conversation by reacting abruptly to Wendy’s innocent questions about his quiet demeanor.
3. **Misunderstanding**: Wendy's innocent question, "Did it hurt?" is answered by the author with anger, as he thinks she refers to emotional pain from losing his mother. However, it's implied that Wendy's perspective might be more profound than the author perceives, potentially talking about the broader notion of pain and loss.
4. **The Aftermath**: When Wendy passes away, it is revealed that she was a child dealing with leukemia, which she didn’t explicitly share with the author when they first met. Despite her situation, she was still able to express joy and leave behind a drawing symbolizing happiness.
5. **Understanding the Options**:
   - **A**. Wendy knew she was going to die: This option aligns with the context, as Wendy,
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A.

Q: article:             She was 6 years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live. She insisted on talking to me. "I'm building," she said. "I see that. What is it?" I asked, not caring. "Oh, I don't know, I just like the feel of sand." That sounds good, I thought, and slipped off my shoes. A sandpiper   glided by. "My mom says sandpipers come to bring us joy." "Good-bye joy," I muttered   to myself, "Hello pain," and turned to walk on. I was depressed; my life seemed completely out of balance. "What's your name?" She wouldn't give up. "Robert," I answered. "Mine's Wendy... I'm 6. Why are you so quiet?" I turned to her and shouted: "Because my mother died!" "Oh," she said quietly, "then this is a bad day." "Yes," I said, "and yesterday and the day before and - oh, go away!" "Did it hurt?" she asked. "Did what hurt?" I was annoyed with her, with myself. "When she died?" "Of course it hurt!" I replied angrily, misunderstanding. A month after that, when I next went to the beach, she wasn't there. Feeling guilty, ashamed, I went up to the cottage and knocked at the door. A young woman answered. "Hello," I said. "I'm Robert Peterson. I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was." "Wendy died last week, Mr. Peterson. She had leukemia . Maybe she didn't tell you." I had to catch my breath, saying nothing. "She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days. But the last few weeks, she declined rapidly... "She left something for you... if only I could find it," she said. "Could you wait a moment while I look?" It was a drawing in bright color1s- a yellow beach, a blue sea, and a brown bird. Underneath was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY. I took Wendy's mother in my arms. "I'm so sorry," I muttered over and over, and we wept together. But then we looked at the picture of the sandpiper and slowly both of us began to smile, remembering the lesson that Wendy had left us. Even when life seems sad, joy can be found in the smallest of things. We should take time to seek out these little joys in life and live for the love that we have for each other.             question:             The author felt guilty when he saw Wendy was not on the beach, because he didn't   _  .             options:             ['A. know the girl had a disease', 'B. treat the girl nicely a month ago', "C. attend the girl's funeral", 'D. keep his promise to meet the girl on the beach']
A: Let's think step by step.
The text provides a narrative where the author, Robert, initially interacts with a young girl named Wendy on the beach. During their conversation, Robert is upset and ends up being harsh with Wendy when she persistently asks about his feelings. This unpleasant interaction is a key moment.
A month later, Robert returns to the beach and notices Wendy's absence. Feeling concerned, he visits her family's cottage only to learn from Wendy's mother that Wendy had passed away from leukemia the previous week. The realization that Wendy had been terminally ill and his prior harshness towards her leads to a feeling of guilt.
Now, let's analyze the options:
- **A. know the girl had a disease**: While Robert was unaware of Wendy's illness, the narrative focuses more on his guilt about how he treated her rather than his lack of knowledge about her condition.
- **B. treat the girl nicely a month ago**: This aligns with the text. Robert reflects on his behavior during their last encounter and feels guilty for having been rude, especially given the context of her illness.
- **C. attend the girl's funeral**: The text does not suggest that Robert knew about the funeral, nor does it state he feels guilty about not attending it.
- **D. keep his promise to meet the
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. The author felt guilty because he didn't treat the girl nicely a month ago.

Death is nothing to fear.', 'B. Friendship plays an important role in life.', 'C. Living itself is a kind of happiness.', 'D. A person should enjoy each living day.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man learned from the little girl, we need to analyze the story and the interactions between the characters. 
1. The man meets the little girl, Wendy, on a beach when he is feeling depressed due to personal grief from losing his mother. 
2. Wendy, despite being very young, interacts with Robert and expresses her delight in simple pleasures, like the feel of sand and the sight of sandpipers, which she believes bring joy.
3. Robert dismisses her initially because of his own pain but later learns that Wendy was severely ill and has died. 
4. Despite her illness, Wendy was able to find joy in small things and left behind a drawing symbolizing joy, which helps Robert and her mother find comfort and a reason to smile despite their grief.
5. The key lesson Wendy imparts to Robert is the importance of finding joy in the small things in life, even when circumstances seem overwhelmingly sad.
Considering the options provided:
- Option A, "Death is nothing to fear," doesn't accurately capture the primary lesson as the story's focus isn't on removing the fear of death, but finding joy despite its presence.
- Option B, "Friendship plays an important role in life," is also not the central theme, as the story centers
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. A person should enjoy each living day.'

Q: article:             An allowance is an important tool for teaching kids how to budget, save and make their own decisions. Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly. How large an allowance is appropriate? Experts say there is not right amount. Actual amounts differ from region to region, and from family to family. To set an appropriate allowance for your child, work up a weekly budget. Allow for entertainment expenditures such as movies and snacks. Next, include everyday expenses such as lunch money, bus fare, school supplies. "If you make the child responsible for these ' ills'," says Josephine Swanson, a consumer specialist, " he or she will learn to budget for necessary expenditures." Finally, add some extra money to make saving possible. If you can, keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends. A child whose purchasing power falls away below his peers' can feel left out. It can be tough, but avoid excusing your children when they make a mistake with their allowance. When Brooke Stephens was ten and growing up in Jacksonville, her mother gave her $5 a week, $1.75 of which was for bus fare and lunch." If you lose your money," Brooke's mother told her, "you walk home." One week the girl spent all her allowance in a candy store, then she called home for a ride. " Mom made me walk home," recalls Stephens, now a financial planner in Brooklyn. " At first I was angry. But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson. " Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily chores. Kids should help around the house not because they get paid for it but because they share responsibilities as members of a family. You might, however, pay a child for doing extra jobs at home, which can develop his or her initiative.             question:             Which of the following is the possible title of the passage?             options:             ["A. How to develop a child's initiative.", 'B. How to work up an amount of pocket money.', 'C. How to teach a child to save money.', 'D. How to teach a child about money.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the appropriate title for the passage, let's analyze its main points:
1. The article discusses the concept of giving children an allowance to teach them about budgeting, saving, and decision-making.
2. It highlights the importance of children learning from their financial mistakes and provides guidance on how to set an appropriate allowance by considering various expenses and savings.
3. The passage discourages tying the allowance directly to daily chores but suggests compensating for extra jobs to foster initiative.
4. It shares an illustrative anecdote about a mother teaching her child a lesson in responsibility through the management of an allowance.
Now, let's evaluate the options for the title:
- Option A ("How to develop a child's initiative") focuses solely on initiative development, which is discussed but not the central theme of the passage.
- Option B ("How to work up an amount of pocket money") highlights calculating an allowance, which is part of the passage, but not the overall, encompassing theme.
- Option C ("How to teach a child to save money") is too narrow, as the passage covers a broader scope than just saving.
- Option D ("How to teach a child about money") encapsulates the entire content, which describes budgeting, personal financial responsibility, and learning the value of money through allowances.
Thus,
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

A: Let's think step by step.
The passage talks about how an allowance is a tool for teaching kids about budgeting, saving, and making decisions. Children learn from mistakes made with their own money, which implies that they may initially spend money unwisely. However, through these experiences, they learn to manage money better. The passage also highlights different factors to consider when setting an allowance and mentions that it should not be tied to daily chores but can include extra jobs for additional earnings.
Given this information, let's analyze the options:
- Option A: "spend all the money very soon" - While children might initially spend their money quickly, the focus of the passage is on the learning experience rather than constant imprudence.
- Option B: "be spoiled and finally ruined" - The passage does not suggest that allowances will spoil children; rather, it presents allowances as educational tools.
- Option C: "feel responsible and careful about money" - This option aligns with the purpose of giving allowances. Even though mistakes may occur initially, the overall goal is to teach responsibility and care with money.
- Option D: "lose the money and cannot return home" - This option is overly specific and refers to a single anecdote instead of a general inference applicable to all children with allowances.
Considering all information, Option C
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C

A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what the author implies in the passage, we need to carefully analyze the content and relate it to the options provided.
1. **General Summary of Key Points in the Passage:**
   - Importance of allowances: They help children learn to budget, save, and make decisions.
   - Amounts of allowances vary, and should be planned based on a budget, including necessary expenses and some for savings.
   - Allowances should not be tied to regular chores, but can be given for extra tasks to build initiative.
2. **Consideration of Each Option:**
   - **A. Paying children for their housework is no good.**
     - The passage suggests allowances should not be directly tied to daily chores, but doesn't explicitly say it's "no good" to pay at all.
   
   - **B. A child's initiative can be developed if he or she is paid for all the housework.**
     - The passage suggests that initiative can be developed through payment for extra jobs, not all housework.
   
   - **C. Children may feel lost and lonely if they have no pocket money.**
     - The passage discusses the importance of having allowance in line with peers and not feeling left out, but doesn't use the terms lost or lonely directly.

Q: article:             Shyness is the cause of much unhappiness for a great many people. Shy people are anxious and self-conscious; that is, they are over concerned with their own appearance and actions. Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes? It is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must affect people unfavorably. Adperson's self concept is reflected in the way he or she behaves and the way a person behaves affects other people's reactions. In general, the way people think about themselves has a deep effect on all areas of their lives. Shy people ,have low self-esteem , are likely to be passive and easily influenced by others. They need reassurance(,) that they are doing "the right thing". Shy people are very sensitive to criticism. It makes them feel inferior .They also find it difficult to be pleased by praises because they believe they are unworthy of praise . A shy person may respond to a praise with a statement like this one:" You're just saying that to make me feel good .I know it's not true." It is clear that, while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful. Can shyness be completely got rid of ,or at least reduced? Fortunately, people can overcome shyness with determination. It is important for people to accept their weaknesses as well as their strengths, for example, not fair for them to label themselves inferior because they have to be realistic. Living on the impossible leads to absence of inferiority. Each one of us has his or her own characteristics. We are interested in our own personal ways.

A: Let's think step by step.
First, let's focus on the overall context of the article. The article discusses the concept of shyness and emphasizes how it affects people negatively, leading to unhappiness and self-doubt. It also highlights the importance of self-awareness and self-acceptance.
Now, let's evaluate the statement in the question: "According to the writer, self-awareness is _."
1. **Option A: Harmful to people**  
   The writer acknowledges that being overly self-conscious (extreme self-awareness) can be harmful, but they do not suggest that self-awareness itself is harmful. Instead, moderation is key.
2. **Option B: A weak point of shy people**  
   The article talks about shy people being overly concerned with their own actions, but it does not directly equate this to self-awareness as a weak point.
3. **Option C: The cause of unhappiness**  
   The article does not claim that self-awareness itself is the cause of unhappiness. The issue arises with excessive self-consciousness or concern about others' perceptions.
4. **Option D: A good characteristic**  
   The writer notes that "self-awareness is a healthy quality" when it is balanced and not overdone. This suggests that, in general, self-awareness is viewed positively
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. a good characteristic

   - **A. They are pleased by it**: This contradicts the information in the article, as it mentioned that shy people find it difficult to be pleased by praise.
   - **B. They feel it is not true**: This aligns with the article, as the example provided illustrates a shy person's disbelief in the praise being genuine.
   - **C. They are very sensitive to it**: While shyness involves sensitivity, the article focuses on the disbelief regarding praise rather than just sensitivity.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the passage and the options provided. The passage primarily discusses the negative effects of shyness on individuals and how it can hinder their lives.
1. **Option A: Help us to live up to our full development**
   - The passage does not indicate that shyness helps us in any positive capacity. Instead, it suggests that shyness is an obstacle to personal development.
2. **Option B: Enable us to understand ourselves better**
   - While the passage notes that self-awareness can be healthy, it emphasizes that excessive self-awareness (shyness) is detrimental. It does not suggest that shyness leads to better self-understanding.
3. **Option C: Block our chances for a successful life**
   - This aligns with the passage's theme. The passage states that shyness can cause unhappiness, low self-esteem, and difficulties in life. This implies that shyness can indeed block chances for a successful life.
4. **Option D: Have nothing to do with lack of self-esteem**
   - The passage directly mentions that shy people have low self-esteem, so this option contradicts the information provided in the passage.
Considering the above analysis, the correct answer is:
C. Block our chances for a successful life

Q: article:             A new Canada Prize for the Arts and Creativity could be in place by 2010, with large cash prizes for emerging   artists in dance, music, theatre and visual arts.  The prize is the idea of Tony Gagliano and David Pecaut, founders of the Luminato festival,who were able to convince the federal government to back it. The federal budget has allocated $25 million to support the awards open to emerging artists. The aim is to create a prize that has the prestige   of a Nobel Prize.     "When you think about the major prizes of the world ---- the Nobel Prize in Sweden,the Kyoto prizes in Japan or the Booker Prize in the U.K . --- they bring great honor and opportunity to the countries that award them," Pecaut said."The idea here is that every year,the Canada prizes will be awarded to the very best promising emerging artists around the world in those four fields.

"             question:             Why did David Pecaut have the idea of founding a new Ganada Prize?             options:             ['A. To enlarge the content of the Luminato festival.', "B. To advance Canada's honor and opportunities.", 'C. To consider his own benefits from the prize.', 'D. To make more Canadians get world prizes.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the motivation behind David Pecaut's idea of founding a new Canada Prize based on the information provided in the article.
1. **Article Context**: The remarks made by Pecaut in the provided article highlight his view that prestigious international awards such as the Nobel Prize, Kyoto Prizes, and Booker Prize bring honor and opportunity to the countries awarding them.
2. **Pecaut's Aim**: According to the article, Pecaut mentioned the intention of awarding the Canada prizes to promising emerging artists worldwide in dance, music, theatre, and visual arts, emphasizing the prestige similar to renowned international prizes.
3. **Canada's Prestige**: It's explicitly stated that one motivation for the Canadian federal government backing this idea is to advance Canada's brand on the international stage, drawing tourists and arts professionals, and creating international connections for Canadian artists.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each of the options with respect to the provided information in the article.
- The article mentions that the Canada Prize will have 12 finalists judged by a jury of international experts, but it does not explicitly state that these 12 finalists will all be winners. Therefore, "A. have at least twelve winners" cannot be confirmed as the correct answer.
- The prize is said to be open to emerging artists in four fields: dance, music, theatre, and visual arts. This strongly implies that the prize will be divided into four parts based on these disciplines, making "B. be divided into four detailed parts" a probable option.
- There is no mention in the article of the prize being held every four years; rather, the article refers to the potential for semi-final rounds to coincide with the Vancouver Olympic Games, which does not suggest a quadrennial event. Thus, "C. be held every four years in Canada" is not supported by the text.
- The federal budget has allocated $25 million to support the awards, but this is not stated as the amount awarded to each winner. Thus, "D. offer every winner about $25 million" is incorrect.
Considering the above analysis, the most fitting option based on

Q: article:             Looking good, feeling good Born to a model mom and a suit maker dad, fashion was actually in my blood. I always had a strong desire to dress in a certain way and to stand out from the crowd. I made my own toys when I was a young child and sewed my first skirt at just 10 years old. A friend's mother took one look at my skirt and told me that I should be a patternmaker. In high school I started making my own clothes, mostly changing other things because I never liked anything how it was when I bought it. During the last two years of school, I worked part-time for a small business that made hand-painted silk clothing and bags. The owner became the teacher who got me into design in the first place. Another useful bit of work experience then came when I worked at a showroom during fashion week and found it very exciting. From there I worked at a top clothing store while I got my business started. For my business I started out with the idea that everything I did would be hand-made and one-of-a-kind, specially made for one individual who hopefully had the same tastes as me. Every morning I jumped out of bed, went to my studio and worked on my projects. This just showed how enthusiastic I felt about my work. And at night I even dreamed of new designs! Fashion design is _ art. What I mean is that it's something close to you and something you can touch and feel, and actually interact with. My advice to any young person who wants to be a fashion designer is to get the basic skills early on, such as sewing and pattern-making. Even if you end up specializing, it's really important to understand all aspects of design in order to make high-quality clothes. Also, if you dream of having your own clothing line, the best thing to do is start wearing your clothes. You have to try and do this because that's the way you're going to develop something that's all yours and unlike anyone else's.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the author did in high school, we should refer to the relevant part of the passage. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:
1. The author mentions starting to make her own clothes in high school, specifically changing other things because she never liked how they were originally. This suggests she was involved in creating and modifying clothing during this time.
2. She worked part-time for a small business that made hand-painted silk clothing, which indicates an involvement with hand-painted clothing, though it doesn't specify if she was fond of it or not.
3. There is no mention in the passage of the author wearing the latest fashions or dressing the same way as her classmates during high school.
Given these points, the statement that accurately reflects what the author did during high school is: "C. began to make clothes on her own."
Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. began to make clothes on her own.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the advice given by the author to those who want to be fashion designers, we should focus on the relevant portions of the text surrounding this topic.
1. The author mentions the importance of getting "the basic skills early on," specifically citing "sewing and pattern-making" as fundamental skills. This indicates a focus on foundational skills rather than high school design creation or observing friends.
2. The advice includes understanding "all aspects of design in order to make high-quality clothes." This suggests a well-rounded approach to learning various aspects of fashion design, not necessarily just looking at friends' clothing or random high-quality garments.
3. The author also suggests starting by wearing one's own clothes to "develop something that's all yours and unlike anyone else's," which aligns with the idea of finding uniqueness and personal style in your work.
Analyzing the options:
- A. Creating basic designs in high school: While the author talks about getting basic skills, there's no specific emphasis on creating designs during high school. The focus is more on acquiring skills early.
  
- B. Wearing high-quality clothes all the time: This does not capture the essence of the author's advice. The emphasis is on making clothes rather than just wearing high-quality ones.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to determine which option aligns with what the author of the article believes about well-designed clothes. The last sentence of the article provides a significant hint: "I passionately believe that the right clothing can make people feel better and give them more confidence."
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: "cost people a lot of money" - This is not mentioned or implied by the author. The focus is on the impact and feeling that clothing provides, not the cost.
  
- Option B: "bring people great success" - While clothing might contribute to someone’s confidence, which in turn might help with success, the article does not explicitly state this. The emphasis is more on personal feelings rather than external success.
  
- Option C: "provide people with popular taste" - The author talks about creating unique, personalized clothing rather than popular styles, so this does not seem to fit with the author's views.
  
- Option D: "help people feel sure of themselves" - This aligns closely with the author's statement about clothing making people feel better and giving them more confidence. Thus, it is the most suitable choice based on the article.

Q: article:             Microsoft just finished a three-month experiment operating an underwater data center.A server rack  with the power of about 300PCs was placed into a water-tight  steel container and lowered into the ocean off the coast of central California. The unusual experiment was launched because current data centers are unpleasantly inefficient.They're built where energy and land are cheap (not close to where people actually live).And they waste so much energy cooling their massive computers.The ocean can solve those problems.The cold ocean floor sufficiently cools the computing components inside the pod.And since most people live near the ocean,placing data centers under water could potentially increase the speed at which customers could access the information stored in Microsoft's cloud. The experiment was so successful that Microsoft operated the underwater data center for 75days longer than it had planned to.The next step is to get a larger pod,with about four times the computing power,under the ocean for testing.Unlike the first experiment,the next pod will also be equipped with turbines,which will transform the ocean's currents into electricity.It's not clear when,if ever,underwater data centers will become a possible product."Our first experiment was like dipping our pinkie toe in the water,and now we're going for the big toe,"said Lee,corporate vice president of Microsoft Research. Microsoft is still analyzing the environmental impacts of the study.Data centers are both hot and loud,which could have damaging effects on ocean life.Microsoft found that the noise its underwater data center produced was drowned out by nearby shrimp and crabs.The data centers are also built from recyclable materials,and Microsoft believes that the total carbon footprint of underwater data centers will be"dramatically lower"than current land-based centers. Given the growth in the cloud,industry analysts believe that most of the world's data centers have yet to be built.But building a data center takes at least two years-an  eternity in the fast-developing tech industry.As a result,Microsoft builds its data centers with the future in mind,installing far more computing power and space than it currently needs. Lee believes that going under water can shift the building of data centers from construction projects to manufacturing jobs."What if we could mass-produce these pods on an assembly line?"he thought."We could deliver a data center,from conception to operation,in 90days.That's dramatically different than what's happening today."             question:             What is the advantage of an underwater data center?             options:             ['A. It can be lowered to the ocean floor easily.', 'B. It can cool computing components automatically.', 'C. It can be built close to the place where people live.', 'D. It can make information easily accessible to people.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the advantage of an underwater data center, let's consider the contents of the article step by step:
1. **Cooling Efficiency**: The article mentions that data centers are usually inefficient because they require a lot of energy for cooling their massive computers. It states that the "cold ocean floor sufficiently cools the computing components inside the pod," which implies that the underwater data center benefits from natural cooling provided by the ocean.
2. **Proximity to Population Centers**: Since "most people live near the ocean," placing data centers underwater could "potentially increase the speed at which customers could access the information stored in Microsoft's cloud." This suggests that underwater data centers can be closer to where people live compared to traditional data centers.
3. **Efficient Construction and Deployment**: The article discusses Microsoft's vision of shifting the construction of data centers to a manufacturing model, allowing for faster deployment. However, this is more about the manufacturing process than an inherent feature of the underwater setting.
4. **Environmental and Noise Consideration**: While the article mentions the environmental impacts and noise levels, it doesn't directly relate these points to an advantage of underwater placement.

A: Let's think step by step.
To infer what can be determined about the underwater data centers, let's analyze the details provided in the article:
1. **Environmental Impact**:
   - The article mentions that Microsoft is still analyzing the environmental impacts. However, it notes that the noise produced by the underwater data center was drowned out by nearby shrimp and crabs, suggesting minimal disturbance to ocean life. Additionally, the data centers are made from recyclable materials, and Microsoft believes the carbon footprint will be "dramatically lower" than that of land-based centers.
   - This suggests that the underwater data centers could be more environmentally friendly (Option B) and cause little harm to ocean life (Option A).
2. **Impact on Ocean Currents**:
   - The article mentions that the next generation of pods will have turbines to harness ocean currents for energy, but there is no mention of changing the course of the currents. Hence, Option C cannot be inferred from the information given.
3. **Ease of Construction**:
   - The article suggests that mass-producing data center pods on an assembly line could reduce the time of delivery from conception to operation to 90 days. This indicates that they may become easier to build in large quantities (Option D) in the future, but this is speculative and not a direct inference based
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

Q: article:             There was a king who gave his daughter a beautiful diamond necklace. The necklace was stolen and his people in the kingdom searched everywhere but could not find it. So the king asked to search for it and put a reward for$50,000 for anyone who found it. One day, a clerk was walking home along a river when he saw something shinning in the river and when he looked, he saw the diamond necklace. He decided to try and catch it to get the $50,000 reward. He put his hand in the river and tried to catch the necklace, but somehow missed it and didn't catch it. He took his hand out and looked again and the necklace was still there. He tried again. But strangely, he still missed the necklace! He came out and started walking away, feeling sad. Just then, an old man walking by saw him, and asked him what was the matter. The clerk didn't want to share the secret with him, thinking he might take the necklace for himself, so he refused to tell him anything. The old man could see this man was troubled. He again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tell anyone about it. The clerk told him about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing. The old man then told him that perhaps he should try looking upward, toward the branches of the tree, instead of in the river. The clerk looked up and true enough, the necklace was hanging on the branch of a tree. He had been trying to take a reflection of the real necklace all this time.             question:             The clerk tried to get the diamond necklace to   _  .             options:             ['A. make the king happy.', 'B. keep it for himself.', 'C. get the big reward.', 'D. sell it at a high price.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The story mentions that the king offered a reward of $50,000 to anyone who found the stolen diamond necklace. When the clerk saw what looked like the diamond necklace in the river, he decided to try and catch it to obtain this reward. The narrative does not suggest that the clerk intended to keep the necklace for himself, sell it, or make the king happy explicitly. His primary motivation, as provided by the context of the $50,000 reward, was to get the reward. 
Therefore, the most logical conclusion is:
C. get the big reward.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

A: Let's think step by step.
The article describes how the clerk, after multiple attempts to retrieve the diamond necklace from the river, eventually felt sad and started to walk away. At that moment, the old man noticed him and asked what was the matter. The key point here is focusing on what the clerk felt before the old man approached him.
The clerk had been exerting himself trying to grab the necklace, and after failing repeatedly, he began to walk away in a state of sadness or dissatisfaction. This emotional state indicates that the clerk was not feeling good. Although he wasn't actively searching the water or seeking help right before the old man's inquiry, his primary state was one of disappointment or dissatisfaction with the situation. 
Thus, the most fitting option describing the clerk's state before the old man spoke to him is:
'D. was not feeling good'

On the tree', 'B. On the bank', 'C. In the river', 'D. In the sand']
A: Let's think step by step.
The story describes how the clerk initially believed he saw the diamond necklace in the river and tried several times to retrieve it. Each time he attempted to grab the necklace, he failed because he was actually reaching for the necklace's reflection in the water, not the real necklace. 
The turning point comes when an old man advises the clerk to look upward instead of into the river. Upon following this advice, the clerk realizes that the actual necklace was never in the river; it was hanging on a branch of a tree above the water. 
Thus, the location where the clerk ultimately finds the actual necklace is "on the tree."
The correct answer is: **A. On the tree**.

A beautiful diamond necklace', "B. A king's promise", 'C. A lucky young clerk', 'D. Changing the way of thinking']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, we need to consider the main theme or lesson of the story.
1. **A Beautiful Diamond Necklace**: While the necklace is a key element of the story, the narrative is more about the discovery process and the lesson learned, rather than the necklace itself.
2. **A King's Promise**: The king's promise of a reward sets the story in motion, but the main focus is on the clerk's efforts and realization rather than the king's role or promise.
3. **A Lucky Young Clerk**: The story can involve an element of luck—discovering the necklace and the encounter with the old man—but the core lesson is about changing perspective rather than sheer luck.
4. **Changing the Way of Thinking**: This option emphasizes the story's moral or lesson: the clerk needed to shift his perspective to find the actual necklace. The old man's advice to change his viewpoint—from looking in the river to looking up at the tree—ultimately leads to the discovery of the real necklace.
Given that the story's crucial turning point is about altering perception and seeing beyond illusions, the best title that encapsulates this theme is "D. Changing the Way of Thinking."
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

Q: article:             The man who admitted to killing an Italian woman inside her East Harlem apartment said he was possessed by an "evil spell  ," police said Thursday.     Bakary Camara, 41, who once dated the murdered woman, penned his admission of guilt in a three-page letter folded in his pocket as he tried to kill himself after policemen burst into his home. Kelly, a policeman, said "He says that there was an evil spell that was cast on him." Camara, who was in stable condition at St. Barnabas Hospital, was later charged with the murder of Rita Morelli.     The 36-year-old woman was getting a degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College as she waited tables at Caffe Buon Gusto on the upper East Side, police said. Camara called 911 from a payphone after killing the lively Morelli on Nov. 23.     Her body was later found in her E. 120th St. home. She was hanged and had knife wounds to her throat and chest.     Policemen began dialing numbers from Morelli's cell phone and when Camara picked up, a detective recognized his voice as the man who called in the report of a dead body, police said. When officers went to Camara's home, he locked himself inside, forcing policemen to burst down the front door to catch him.     "He is standing there with a knife pointed at his chest," Kelly, a policeman, said. "He makes threatening statements as to the fact that he killed the woman. He then stabs himself in the chest." Camara, who told police he served six years in prison for robbery back in his native country, was still waiting to be charged with murder Thursday.     Morelli left her hometown of Spoltore, Italy, five years ago to fully experience the arts and music culture of the big city, her family said.             question:             The reason why Camara killed the woman was   _  .             options:             ["A. he didn't love her any more", "B. the passage didn't tell us clearly", 'C. he killed her by mistake', 'D. he loved her dearly']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct reason why Camara killed the woman according to the article, let's analyze the information provided:
1. The article mentions that Bakary Camara admitted to killing the Italian woman, Rita Morelli, and that he once dated her.
2. Camara claimed that he was possessed by an "evil spell" when he committed the murder, which suggests that he might believe some external force or influence caused him to act against his will.
3. There's no mention in the article of Camara killing Morelli by mistake (Option C) or due to lack of love (Option A) or because he loved her dearly (Option D).
4. The passage mainly focuses on Camara's claim of an "evil spell," indicating that this is the given reason for his actions according to the context of his admission.
Considering these points, the most accurate answer is:
  
B. the passage didn't tell us clearly

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true according to the passage, let's evaluate each option based on the information provided:
- **Option A: Morelli and Camara are both Italians.**  
  The passage mentions that Rita Morelli was an Italian woman, but it does not specify Camara's nationality. All we know is that Camara served six years in prison in his native country, but the country is not mentioned. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Camara is Italian. This statement is false.
- **Option B: Camara will be sentenced to six years in prison.**  
  The passage does not provide information about Camara's sentence for the murder. It only states that he has been charged and was waiting to be charged with murder. There is no mention of any sentencing, let alone a specific term of six years. This statement is false.
- **Option C: Camara was once in prison for six years.**  
  The passage explicitly states that Camara told police he served six years in prison for robbery in his native country. This statement is true.
- **Option D: Camara was seriously wounded.**  
  The passage mentions that Camara was in stable condition at the hospital after stabbing himself in the chest. While stabbing oneself
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. Camara was once in prison for six years.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to examine the information provided in the article carefully:
1. **Camara was in his native country**:
   - The article states that Camara served six years in prison for robbery in his native country, but there is no information suggesting he is currently in his native country. Therefore, option A is not relevant.
2. **"Evil spell" really works**:
   - The article mentions Camara's claim of being possessed by an "evil spell," but this is presented as his excuse or reasoning, not as a factual statement. The article does not confirm whether an "evil spell" actually works, so option B is not supported by the passage.
3. **Camara and Morelli are husband and wife**:
   - The article reveals that Camara once dated Morelli, indicating they had a previous romantic relationship. However, there is no evidence suggesting they were married. Thus, option C is incorrect.
4. **Camara and Morelli knew each other**:
   - The article specifically notes that Camara once dated Morelli, which confirms they knew each other. Therefore, option D is supported by the passage.
Upon evaluating all the options, it is clear that the correct answer is:
D.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. Camara and Morelli knew each other

1. **Passage**: The article states that Morelli's body was found in her E. 120th St. home, indicating she was murdered there.
   - **A.** She was murdered in Camara's home.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what Camara did after killing the woman, let's analyze the key details from the article:
1. **After the Crime**: The article mentions that Camara called 911 from a payphone after killing Morelli. This indicates he reported the crime to the authorities.
2. **Police Interaction**: It's noted that police began to investigate by calling numbers from Morelli's cell phone and recognized Camara's voice from the 911 call. This recognition implies that he indeed called to report a dead body.
3. **Subsequent Actions**: When police went to his home, Camara locked himself inside and threatened to harm himself with a knife when confronted by the police.
4. **Attempted Suicide**: After the police forced entry, Camara attempted to stab himself, which suggests a possible regret or desperation after the act.
Given this information, we can evaluate the options:
- **A. He called to report a dead body.** - This option aligns with the article mentioning that Camara called 911 after the murder, which led to police recognizing his voice.
  
- **B. He called the hospital to save the woman.** - There is no indication in the article that Camara made any attempt to save the woman or contact a

Q: article:             Many scientists today are convinced that life exists elsewhere in the universe---life probably much like that on our own planet. They reason in the following way.   As far as astronomers can determine, the entire universe is built of the same matter. They have no reason to doubt that matter obeys the same laws in every part of the universe. Therefore, it is reasonable to guess that other stars, with their own planets, were born in the same way as our own solar system. What we know of life on earth suggests that life will arise wherever the proper conditions exist.   Life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere. This eliminates  all those planets in the universe that are not about the same size and weight as the earth. A smaller planet would lose its atmosphere; a larger one would hold too much of it.   Life also requires a steady supply of heat and light. This eliminates double stars, or stars that flare up suddenly. Only single stars that are steady sources of heat and light like our sun would qualify.   Finally, life could evolve  only if the planet is just the right distance from its sun. With a weaker sun than our own, the planet would have to be closer to it. With a stronger sun, it would have to be farther away.   If we suppose that every star in the universe has a family of planets, then how many planets might support life? First, eliminate those stars that are not like our sun. Next eliminate most of their planets; they are either too far from or too close to their suns. Then eliminate all those planets which are not the same size and weight as the earth. Finally, remember that the proper conditions do not necessarily mean that life actually does exist on a planet. It may not have begun yet, or it may have already died out.   This process of elimination seems to leave very few planets on which earthlike life might be found. However, even if life could exist on only one planet in a million, there are so many billions of planets that this would still leave a vast number on which life could exist.             question:             The existence of life depends on all of the following factors EXCEPT   _  .             options:             ['A. the right amount of atmosphere', 'B. our own solar system', 'C. steady heat and light', 'D. the right distance from the sun']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the factor that is not necessary for the existence of life, we'll analyze each option:
A. The right amount of atmosphere: The article mentions that life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere, which eliminates planets that are not about the same size and weight as Earth. This factor is necessary for the existence of life.
B. Our own solar system: The article discusses conditions similar to those on Earth but does not state that life requires being within our own solar system. It focuses on similar conditions existing elsewhere in the universe. Thus, this factor is not necessary for the existence of life elsewhere.
C. Steady heat and light: The article clearly states that life requires a steady supply of heat and light, which eliminates stars that are not like our sun. This factor is necessary for the existence of life.
D. The right distance from the sun: The article notes that life could only evolve if the planet is at the right distance from its sun, considering the sun's strength. This factor is necessary for the existence of life.
Based on the analysis, the existence of life depends on all the factors listed, except for "B. our own solar system." Therefore, the correct answer is B. our own solar system.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B

Q: article:             Many scientists today are convinced that life exists elsewhere in the universe---life probably much like that on our own planet. They reason in the following way.   As far as astronomers can determine, the entire universe is built of the same matter. They have no reason to doubt that matter obeys the same laws in every part of the universe. Therefore, it is reasonable to guess that other stars, with their own planets, were born in the same way as our own solar system. What we know of life on earth suggests that life will arise wherever the proper conditions exist.   Life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere. This eliminates  all those planets in the universe that are not about the same size and weight as the earth. A smaller planet would lose its atmosphere; a larger one would hold too much of it.   Life also requires a steady supply of heat and light. This eliminates double stars, or stars that flare up suddenly. Only single stars that are steady sources of heat and light like our sun would qualify.   Finally, life could evolve  only if the planet is just the right distance from its sun. With a weaker sun than our own, the planet would have to be closer to it. With a stronger sun, it would have to be farther away.   If we suppose that every star in the universe has a family of planets, then how many planets might support life? First, eliminate those stars that are not like our sun. Next eliminate most of their planets; they are either too far from or too close to their suns. Then eliminate all those planets which are not the same size and weight as the earth. Finally, remember that the proper conditions do not necessarily mean that life actually does exist on a planet. It may not have begun yet, or it may have already died out.

The planet must be as big and heavy as the earth.', 'B. Proper conditions are essential to the existence of life.', 'C. Double stars can provide steady light and heat.', 'D. The distance between a planet and its sun should be right.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is incorrect, let's analyze the information provided in the article.
1. **Statement A**: "The planet must be as big and heavy as the earth."  
   - The article does mention that life requires a planet of the right size and weight, similar to Earth, to maintain its atmosphere. Smaller planets might lose their atmosphere, and larger ones might have too much atmosphere. Therefore, this statement is correct according to the article.
2. **Statement B**: "Proper conditions are essential to the existence of life."  
   - The article clearly emphasizes that life requires certain conditions, like the right atmosphere, steady heat and light, and the right distance from its star. Therefore, this statement is correct.
3. **Statement C**: "Double stars can provide steady light and heat."  
   - The article states that life requires a steady supply of heat and light, eliminating double stars or stars that flare up, suggesting that only single, stable stars like our sun are suitable. Therefore, this statement is incorrect as per the article since double stars do not provide steady light and heat.
4. **Statement D**: "The distance between a planet and its sun should be right."  
   - The article mentions that the correct distance from a
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. Double stars can provide steady light and heat.

Most of the planets of the stars.', 'B. Stars similar to our sun.', 'C. Planets similar to the earth.', 'D. Planets with proper conditions.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what kind of planet might NOT support life, we should consider the conditions mentioned in the article that a planet needs to support life.
1. **Planets with the Right Size and Weight**: Life requires planets that are approximately the same size and weight as Earth. Planets that are too small would lose their atmosphere, and those that are too large would hold too much atmosphere, which is unsuitable for life.
2. **Planets with a Steady Supply of Heat and Light**: Life needs a steady supply of heat and light from a single star, similar to our sun. Planets orbiting double stars or stars that flare up are unlikely to support life.
3. **Planets at the Right Distance from Their Sun**: The planet must be at the right distance from its star to receive adequate heat and light for life, similar to Earth's position relative to the sun.
Based on these criteria, we can eliminate planets that do not fit these conditions. 
- **Option A. Most of the planets of the stars**: This option aligns with the text, as it says to eliminate most of the planets that are either too far from or too close to their suns, or not the right size and weight.
- **Option B. Stars similar to our

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage and each option:
The author discusses the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe, reasoning that since the universe is made of the same matter and follows the same laws, life could potentially exist under the right conditions. The author outlines a process of elimination based on factors like atmosphere, steady heat and light, and distance from the sun, indicating that there are specific criteria a planet must meet to support life. Despite the stringent criteria, the author concludes that even if only one planet in a million might support life, the vast number of planets means there would still be a significant number where life could exist.
Now, let's evaluate each option:
- **A. it is impossible for life to exist on planets.**  
  This contradicts the passage, where the author suggests that life could exist given the right conditions.
- **B. earthlike life could only exist on a few planets.**  
  While the passage discusses a process of elimination that results in few suitable planets, the conclusion highlights the vast number of potential candidates, making this option partially correct but not the best choice.
- **C. life could exist on only one planet in a million.**  
  This statement is part of the elimination process mentioned in the passage
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. life could exist on a great number of planets.

Q: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']
A: Let's think step by step.
The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include:
1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities.
2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights.
3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep.
4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests.
Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'.

Cloning itself gives parents great power over identity.', "B. People's identity is completely determined by their genes.", "C. Government has the rights to confirm people's identities.", 'D. Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the author's opinion about identity in the context of cloning, let's analyze the relevant parts of the article.
1. The author raises concerns about identity by asking, "What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity?" This suggests that the author believes cloning could interfere with an individual's ability to possess a unique identity.
2. The sentence "True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities" directly supports option D: "Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities."
3. The other options do not align with the author's opinion expressed in the article:
   - Option A is somewhat related but it emphasizes power over identity, which is not the main point the author makes about identity per se.
   - Option B is not supported because the author does not claim that identity is solely determined by genes.
   - Option C is not relevant because the author does not discuss government roles in identity.
Given this analysis, the correct answer is option D: "Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities."

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's evaluate each option in relation to the content of Paragraph 4 of the provided article.
Paragraph 4 discusses the high failure rate in cloning experiments, specifically referencing the case of Dolly the sheep, where over 200 sheep embryos were used, but only one survived. 
- **A. human cloning is much more difficult than animal cloning**: This is not directly addressed in Paragraph 4. The paragraph discusses cloning difficulties in general, particularly highlighting the case of sheep (animals), but it does not explicitly compare human cloning to animal cloning.
- **B. there are 200 sheep successfully cloned**: This is incorrect. Paragraph 4 mentions that Dolly was the only successful case out of over 200 attempts. It does not say that 200 sheep were successfully cloned.
- **C. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort**: This option is supported by the content of Paragraph 4. The paragraph notes the high failure rate where only one out of over 200 embryos resulted in a living clone, implying that much effort could be wasted in the cloning process.
- **D. numbers of baby animals are likely to be created by cloning**: This is not supported by the paragraph, which emphasizes the high failure rate and the fact

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, we must first analyze its content and the author's main argument. 
1. The article begins by mentioning popular movies that depict cloning, primarily to establish that much of what is depicted is fictional or exaggerated. The intention is to inform the reader that the reality of cloning is different and possibly more concerning.
2. The author then clearly states a position, which is that human cloning is wrong. They present several arguments to support this stance:
   - Concerns about identity and the right to a unique genetic identity.
   - The large power imbalance created by cloning.
   - The ethical implications related to the destruction of embryos.
   - The dangers and high failure rates associated with cloning, both for the birth mother and the clone.
3. The overall message conveyed by the author is that the risks and ethical concerns associated with human cloning outweigh any potential benefits. The passage argues strongly against human cloning from ethical, identity, and safety perspectives.
Considering these points, the title of the passage must reflect the author's clear stance and the arguments laid out. Let's evaluate the options:
- 'A. What Is Human Cloning' is not appropriate as it suggests the article is informative about the process, rather than evaluative or opinion-based.

She was right; Simon really enjoyed army life and became a well-respected member. However, Simon's life was changed forever in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, which belong to Britain, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared war . Simon was on board a ship taking troops to the Falklands when it was attacked and set on fire. In an act of great heroism, Simon tried to save one of his friends from being burnt alive. Sadly, he failed and was seriously burnt himself. At the age of 21, Simon's life seemed over. Simon had 70 operations to rebuild his face and body. He was so badly burnt that his mother walked past him in the hospital without recognizing her son. Simon struggled to call out, "Mum, it's me, Simon." Hearing his voice, his mother broke down in tears. Many thought Simon would die, but to everyone's astonishment, he survived. Although he experienced terrible pain, Simon never gave up hope. After months of treatment, Simon slowly started to recover and, although he would be terribly scarred for the rest of his life, he was able to leave hospital. This was when _ . The physical pain slowly disappeared; however, the emotional pain became worse. Simon started to gout but was wounded by the stares of people who looked at him like he was some kind of freak . He felt like saying, "I wasn't born like this you know. I was injured defending my country." It took great courage for Simon to continue to go out. Eventually, Simon became involved in charity work and met his wife Lucy with whom he has three children. Life has never been the same for Simon but his Bravery is an example to us all.             question:             Simon's mother wanted him to join the army because   _  .             options:             ['A. he liked the life in the army', 'B. she wanted him to be fit', 'C. he was very good at playing sports', 'D. she felt it would change his behavior.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify why Simon's mother wanted him to join the army. The article mentions that as a teenager, Simon could be "naughty sometimes," which implies he might have been misbehaving or lacking discipline. Because of this, his mother made the decision for him to join the army at sixteen with the hope that it would "teach him some discipline." This indicates that her primary motivation for him joining the army was to change his behavior and instill discipline in him.
Now, let's review the options given:
- A. he liked the life in the army - This is incorrect because there is no mention that Simon liked army life before he joined.
- B. she wanted him to be fit - There's no suggestion in the article that his physical fitness was a motive for joining the army.
- C. he was very good at playing sports - While he was a good football player, the article doesn't connect this directly to his joining the army.
- D. she felt it would change his behavior - This aligns perfectly with the article's explanation that the mother wanted Simon to learn discipline, addressing his occasional naughtiness.
Therefore, the correct answer is D. she felt it would change his behavior.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

He succeeded in saving his friend in danger.', 'B. he became an excellent professional soldier.', "C. he didn't get along with other soldiers.", 'D. he found life in the army very terrible']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we can infer about Simon from the text, let's examine each option in light of the information provided:
A. "He succeeded in saving his friend in danger." - The text states that Simon tried to save one of his friends from being burnt alive but sadly failed. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.
B. "He became an excellent professional soldier." - The text mentions that Simon enjoyed army life and became a well-respected member, indicating that he was probably good at his role in the army. This makes Option B a plausible inference.
C. "He didn't get along with other soldiers." - There is no mention in the text of Simon having any conflicts or issues with other soldiers. In fact, trying to save a friend suggests that he had good relations with at least some soldiers. Therefore, Option C is not supported.
D. "He found life in the army very terrible." - The text states that Simon really enjoyed army life, suggesting the opposite of this option. Hence, Option D is incorrect.
Based on the reasoning above, Option B is the most plausible inference: Simon became an excellent professional soldier.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

Q: article:             As a teenager, Simon Weston wasn't particularly good at his studies, but he was a good football player. He could also be naughty sometimes so his mother decided Simon should join the army when he was sixteen to teach him some discipline . She was right; Simon really enjoyed army life and became a well-respected member. However, Simon's life was changed forever in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, which belong to Britain, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared war . Simon was on board a ship taking troops to the Falklands when it was attacked and set on fire. In an act of great heroism, Simon tried to save one of his friends from being burnt alive. Sadly, he failed and was seriously burnt himself. At the age of 21, Simon's life seemed over. Simon had 70 operations to rebuild his face and body. He was so badly burnt that his mother walked past him in the hospital without recognizing her son. Simon struggled to call out, "Mum, it's me, Simon." Hearing his voice, his mother broke down in tears. Many thought Simon would die, but to everyone's astonishment, he survived. Although he experienced terrible pain, Simon never gave up hope. After months of treatment, Simon slowly started to recover and, although he would be terribly scarred for the rest of his life, he was able to leave hospital. This was when _ . The physical pain slowly disappeared; however, the emotional pain became worse. Simon started to gout but was wounded by the stares of people who looked at him like he was some kind of freak . He felt like saying, "I wasn't born like this you know. I was injured defending my country." It took great courage for Simon to continue to go out. Eventually, Simon became involved in charity work and met his wife Lucy with whom he has three children. Life has never been the same for Simon but his Bravery is an example to us all.             question:             Which of the following can best describe Simon?             options:             ['A. Aggressive and strong.', 'B. Calm and kind', 'C. Brave and generous', 'D. Strange and selfish.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option best describes Simon, we need to consider key aspects of his story as presented in the article:
1. **Bravery:** 
   - Simon exhibited great bravery when he tried to save his friend from being burnt, which was an act of heroism.
   - Despite being severely burned and facing immense challenges in his recovery, Simon did not give up hope and endured significant pain.
2. **Generosity and Kindness:**
   - After his recovery, Simon became involved in charity work, which is an indicator of his generosity and desire to help others.
   - His willingness to face public scrutiny and emotional pain shows a dedication to living a life beyond his injuries, contributing positively to society.
3. **Aggressiveness or Strength:**
   - The article does not emphasize Simon being aggressive. While strength can be implied through his perseverance, it is more about inner strength than physical strength or aggressiveness.
   
4. **Calmness:**
   - Although Simon faced challenges with courage, the article does not specifically highlight him as calm or particularly kind beyond his charitable actions.
5. **Strangeness or Selfishness:**
   - There is no indication from the article that Simon is strange or selfish. On the contrary, his actions are
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. Brave and generous.

Q: article:             Our surroundings are being polluted faster than nature and man's present efforts cannot prevent it. Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities, and the growing use of man-made materials. What can explain and solve this problem? The fact is that pollution is caused by man--by his desire for a modern way of life. We make "increasing industrialization" our chief aim. So we are often ready to offer everything: clean air, pure water, good food, our health and the future of our children. There is a constant flow of people from the countryside into the cities, eager for the benefits of our modern society. But as our technological achievements have grown in the last twenty years, pollution has become a serious problem. Isn't it time we stopped to ask ourselves where we are going--and why? It makes one think of the story about the airline pilot who told his passengers over the loudspeaker, "I've some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we're making rapid progress at 530 miles per hour. The bad news is that we're lost and don't know where we're going." The sad fact is that this becomes a true story when spoken of our modern society.             question:             Man cannot prevent the world from being polluted mainly because  _  .             options:             ['A. the population of the world is decreasing fast', 'B. people use too many man-made materials', 'C. we have more and more industry', 'D. we are producing more cars, trucks and buses']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the main reason suggested in the passage for why pollution cannot be prevented effectively.
1. **Understanding the Cause of Pollution:** The passage states that pollution is caused by man's desire for a modern way of life, including increasing industrialization, more cars, and larger cities. This suggests that industrialization and the accompanying lifestyle are major contributors to pollution.
2. **Population Growth and Industrialization:** The passage highlights that time is bringing more people, leading to more industry. It mentions a "constant flow of people from the countryside into cities," which translates to urbanization and industrial expansion. This indicates that increased population leads to more industry.
3. **Man-Made Materials and Cars:** The passage also points to the "growing use of man-made materials" and the production of more cars as contributors to pollution.
4. **Primary Focus:** Despite mentioning various factors, the passage repeatedly emphasizes industrialization connected with population growth, suggesting that this is the overarching cause of pollution.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. The passage does not claim that the world's population is decreasing. It actually implies the opposite.
- **Option B:** While the use of man-made materials contributes, it is not presented as the main
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. The passage emphasizes industrialization as a core issue, which is why "we have more and more industry" is the main reason given for man's inability to

Industry.', 'B. Health.', 'C. Clean air.', 'D. The future of the children.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what man values most according to the passage, we should carefully analyze the content provided. The passage discusses how modern man's desire for a modern way of life and increasing industrialization has led to pollution and the neglect of other important aspects such as clean air, pure water, good food, health, and the future of our children. It highlights that people are willing to sacrifice these things in pursuit of industrial growth and technological achievements. Let's consider each option:
- **A. Industry.** The passage explicitly states that mankind is making "increasing industrialization" its chief aim. This implies that industry is highly valued, possibly above other aspects mentioned.
- **B. Health.** The passage notes that health is something that is sacrificed for the sake of industrialization, implying it is not as highly valued.
- **C. Clean air.** Similarly, clean air is mentioned as something being sacrificed, suggesting it is not the most valued.
- **D. The future of the children.** The future of our children is also mentioned as a sacrifice, indicating it is not valued as much as industrial progress.
From this analysis, it's clear that the passage suggests man values industry the most, as it is identified as the chief aim, leading to the neglect of other important values
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A.

A: Let's think step by step.
To analyze the question, let's first understand what the story about the airline pilot is meant to illustrate within the context of the provided text. The airline pilot mentions that they are making rapid progress but are lost and don't know where they are going. This serves as a metaphor for the current state of society as described in the article.
Now, let's consider the given options:
- **A. man knows where the society is going**: This option contradicts the essence of the story, where the pilot admits they are lost. The metaphor implies uncertainty about the future, similar to how society might be advancing rapidly but without a clear direction.
- **B. people do not welcome the rapid development of modern society**: The story of the airline pilot does not imply that people do not welcome progress; rather, it questions the direction and purpose of this progress.
- **C. man can do little about the problem of pollution**: This option does not directly relate to the story about the pilot but rather addresses the broader theme of pollution addressed in the article. The pilot's story is more about the direction or purpose rather than the inability to tackle a problem.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify the reason why people are moving from the countryside to the cities, according to the context provided in the article.
1. **Understanding the context of the article**: The article discusses how our surroundings are being polluted due to industrialization and a surge in people migrating to cities. It highlights a desire for a modern way of life as a primary driving force behind these migrations.

Q: article:             Humans are naturally drawn to other life forms and the worlds outside of our own. We take delight in the existence of creatures and even whole societies beyond our everyday lives. This sense of wonder is universal. Look at the efforts that scientists have made to find out whether life of some kind exists on Mars, and the popularity of fantasy    literature or movies like The Lord of the Rings. This sense of wonder draws us to each other, to the world around us, and to the world of make-believe, but have we gone so far in creating worlds of fantasy that we are missing the pleasure of other worlds that already exist all around us? Human beings, as biologists have suggested, possess an inborn desire to connect with and understand other life forms. However, people, especially in big cities, often lead rather isolated lives. In a study of British schoolchildren, it was found that children by age eight were much more familiar with characters from television shows and video games than common wildlife. Without modem technology, a small pond could be an amazing world filled with strange and beautiful plants, insects, birds, and animals. When we lack meaningful interaction with the world around us, and sometimes even with our families and friends, we seek to understand and communicate with things that exist only in our imaginations or on a computer screen. The world of make-believe is not necessarily bad, but when the world of fantasy becomes the only outlet for our sense of wonder, then we are really missing something. We are missing a connection with the living world. Other wonderful worlds exist all around us. But even more interesting is that if we look closely enough,we can see that these worlds, in a broad sense ,are really part of our own.             question:             The popularity of The Lord of the Rings proves   _  .             options:             ['A. the close connection between man and the fantasy world', 'B. the wonderful achievements of fantasy literature', 'C. the fine taste of moviegoers around the world', 'D. the general existence of the sense of curiosity']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to evaluate the options based on the provided article. The question asks what the popularity of "The Lord of the Rings" proves.
The article discusses humans' natural wonder and curiosity for other worlds, both real and imaginary. It mentions "The Lord of the Rings" as an example of how people are drawn to fantasy worlds, suggesting that this interest reflects a wider sense of wonder and curiosity in humans.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A**: "The close connection between man and the fantasy world" – The article does discuss the attraction humans have to fantasy worlds, but it does not suggest that there is necessarily a "close connection" in a deep or intrinsic sense; rather, it speaks to our sense of wonder and exploration.
- **Option B**: "The wonderful achievements of fantasy literature" – The article does not focus on the achievements or quality of fantasy literature. It uses fantasy examples to illustrate human curiosity and wonder.
- **Option C**: "The fine taste of moviegoers around the world" – The article is not concerned with the taste or quality of moviegoers, nor does it address this point.
- **Option D**: "The general existence of the sense of curiosity" – This
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is **D**. The article uses "The Lord of the Rings" and other fantasy examples to illustrate the general existence of a sense of curiosity and wonder in humans

To discuss the influence of the world of make-believe.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main purpose of the passage, we should first break down the key points it is making:
1. **Humans have an innate sense of wonder**: The passage starts by acknowledging the universal human attraction to other life forms and worlds beyond our own.
2. **Importance of fantasy**: It discusses how this sense of wonder leads people to explore fantasy worlds through literature and movies, like "The Lord of the Rings."
3. **Real-world connection**: The passage suggests that while fantasy is important, it poses the question of whether this interest in imaginary worlds results in a neglect of the real, diverse worlds around us.
4. **Isolation and technology**: There's emphasis on the isolation experienced by modern individuals, especially those in big cities, and how this could lead to a detachment from the physical, natural world in favor of imaginary interactions, particularly via technology.
5. **Consequences of unbalanced wonder**: It concludes by stating that if fantasy becomes our only source of wonder, we miss out on the meaningful connection to our living world.
Now, let’s evaluate the options:

They describe chocolate as "something to die for" or say "death by chocolate". Now they should bite their tongues! Evidence is showing that some kinds of chocolate are actually good for you in the following ways: A happier heart Scientists at Harvard University recently examined 136 studies on cocoa-- the main ingredient in chocolate-- and found that it does seem to strengthen the heart. Studies have shown heart benefits from increased blood flow. These benefits are the result of cocoa's chemicals, which seem to prevent both cell damage and inflammation .  Better blood pressure If yours is high, chocolate may help. Jeffrey Blumberg from Tufts University recently found that people with high blood pressure who ate 3.5ounces of dark chocolate per day for two weeks saw their blood pressure drop quickly. Muscle magic Chocolate milk may help you recover after a hard workout . _  Better for your skin German researchers gave 24 women a half-cup of special cocoa every day. After three months, the women's skin was moister  and smoother. The research shows that chocolate helps protect and increase blood flow to the skin, improving its appearance. Brain gains. It sounds almost too good to be true, but research suggests that chocolate may improve your memory, attention span, reaction time, and problem-solving skills by increasing blood flow to the brain.             question:             What's the best title for this passage?             options:             ['A.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for this passage, let's evaluate the content of the article and each provided option:
1. **Article Content**:
   - The article discusses several health benefits of chocolate.
   - Key topics include heart health, blood pressure, muscle recovery, skin improvement, and cognitive benefits.
   - The focus is on how certain types of chocolate can be good for you, contradicting the common perception that chocolate is unhealthy.
2. **Options**:
   - **Option A: "Chocolate, a Healthy Food"**
     - This title effectively captures the essence of the article, which highlights multiple health benefits of chocolate.
   - **Option B: "More Chocolate, Less Health"**
     - This title contradicts the article's message, as the article suggests that chocolate can be beneficial, not detrimental, to health.
   - **Option C: "Chocolate and Blood Pressure"**
     - While blood pressure is one aspect covered, it is only a part of the overall benefits discussed, making this title too narrow.
   - **Option D: "Advice on Eating Chocolate"**

Q: article:             As a child, visiting the zoo was more a punishment than a treat. I didn't find the chimps' tea parties funny, nor the bird shows entertaining. Feeding time for seals was less painful, but their performances still seemed like they belonged more in a circus. And I hated circuses, especially the animal acts -- men teasing lions, girls balancing on elephants and monkeys playing football. I knew that every trick a circus animal did was unnatural, achieved through strict training and quite possibly cruelty. Happily, during my lifetime public attitudes and the law have changed. Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved. When my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced. As a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. "Animals belong in the wild," is a common -- and understandable -- complaint. But what do the animals themselves prefer? Generally speaking, zoo animals have a longer life. But -- you may protest -- they are not free. What? Free to be hunted and killed, free to die of hunger or thirst? Maybe sitting in a cage eating bananas isn't so bad. Not that such conditions are acceptable in modern zoos, due to the work of BIAZA, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. These days every zoo requires BIAZA's approval to operate, and the association sets the standards, observes conditions in zoos and develops animal-research programmes, both in the UK and abroad. BIAZA also organises the animal exchanges between zoos all over the world. Consequently, today, most zoo animals are born and raised in zoos, live in large, comfortable enclosures and are cared for by well-trained, knowledgeable and caring zoo employees. Of course it's no substitute for living in the wild but unfortunately this isn't always possible. Meanwhile, why not visit your local zoo and decide for yourself?             question:             The passage is mainly about   _  .             options:             ['A. how zoos have improved', 'B. whether a zoo should be closed down', 'C. a new environmental organisation', 'D. the difference between zoos and circuses']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main topic of the passage, we need to analyze what the author is primarily discussing and emphasizing throughout the text.
1. **The author begins with personal experiences**: The passage starts with the author's childhood experiences with zoos and circuses, describing them as unpleasant due to the treatment of animals.
2. **Changes in public attitudes and laws**: The author notes that public attitudes and the law have changed over time, highlighting that circuses using wild animals are nearly extinct and zoos have evolved.
3. **Discussion on zoos**: The author goes into detail about how zoos have improved. They mention that modern zoos, under the influence of organizations like BIAZA, now have better facilities, standards, and animal care practices than in the past.
4. **Animal welfare and opposition to zoos**: The text also addresses common criticisms of zoos, such as the argument that animals belong in the wild, and counters these by discussing how zoos can provide a safer, longer life for animals.
5. **Modern standards and operations**: The passage describes how contemporary zoos operate with BIAZA's approval and how they strive to maintain high standards of care for animals.

Q: article:             As a child, visiting the zoo was more a punishment than a treat. I didn't find the chimps' tea parties funny, nor the bird shows entertaining. Feeding time for seals was less painful, but their performances still seemed like they belonged more in a circus. And I hated circuses, especially the animal acts -- men teasing lions, girls balancing on elephants and monkeys playing football. I knew that every trick a circus animal did was unnatural, achieved through strict training and quite possibly cruelty. Happily, during my lifetime public attitudes and the law have changed. Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved. When my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced. As a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. "Animals belong in the wild," is a common -- and understandable -- complaint. But what do the animals themselves prefer? Generally speaking, zoo animals have a longer life. But -- you may protest -- they are not free. What? Free to be hunted and killed, free to die of hunger or thirst? Maybe sitting in a cage eating bananas isn't so bad. Not that such conditions are acceptable in modern zoos, due to the work of BIAZA, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. These days every zoo requires BIAZA's approval to operate, and the association sets the standards, observes conditions in zoos and develops animal-research programmes, both in the UK and abroad. BIAZA also organises the animal exchanges between zoos all over the world. Consequently, today, most zoo animals are born and raised in zoos, live in large, comfortable enclosures and are cared for by well-trained, knowledgeable and caring zoo employees. Of course it's no substitute for living in the wild but unfortunately this isn't always possible. Meanwhile, why not visit your local zoo and decide for yourself?             question:             Which of the following roles are performed by BIAZA?             options:             ['A. Organising animal study projects and training zoo workers.', 'B. Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges.', 'C. Designing zoos and approving zoo operations.', 'D. Caring for ill animals and setting zoo standards.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which roles are performed by BIAZA, let's analyze the information provided in the article:
1. The article mentions that BIAZA sets standards for zoos and observes conditions in zoos, which aligns with checking zoo standards and observing conditions.
2. It is also mentioned that BIAZA develops animal-research programs, which corresponds with organizing animal study projects.
3. BIAZA organizes animal exchanges between zoos worldwide, indicating a role in arranging animal exchanges.
4. There is no mention of BIAZA specifically designing zoos, approving zoo operations, caring for ill animals, or training zoo workers in the article.
Based on this analysis, the relevant roles performed by BIAZA focus on setting standards, observing conditions, developing research programs, and organizing animal exchanges. 
Thus, the correct option is:
"B. Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges."
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

Zoos now provide caring living conditions for animals.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement the writer would agree with, let's examine the key points made in the article:
1. **Historical View on Zoos and Circuses:**
   - The writer describes zoo visits and circuses as unpleasant during their childhood, criticizing animal acts as unnatural and possibly cruel.
2. **Evolution of Zoos:**
   - The writer mentions that zoos and public attitudes have evolved over time, noting improvements in both the law and zoo practices.
3. **Modern Zoos:**
   - The writer emphasizes that modern zoos have improved conditions due to the work of organizations like BIAZA, signaling that zoos have more caring and well-regulated environments now.
4. **Comparison with the Wild:**
   - The writer acknowledges that while zoos can't fully replicate the wild, certain conditions (e.g., longer animal lifespans and protection from hunting) can be beneficial compared to the wild.
5. **Current Situation:**
   - The writer expresses that the animals in modern zoos are generally born and raised there, live in large, comfortable enclosures, and are cared for by trained staff.
Now, let's address the options:

Q: article:             In many countries, heart disease kills a lot of women and even more men. There are four major causes of this disease and these are smoking, poor or bad diet, a family history of heart disease and stressful work. Among these main wrong-doers, the most common cause is stress. What is stress and how do you feel when you are under stress? Imagine you live alone - you are lying in bed at night and, suddenly, you hear someone in the kitchen. Immediately your heart begins to beat very fast and you feel that you can hardly breathe. What you are feeling is not stress, but fear. However, your body changes in the same way when you feel stress. That means that if you feel anxious and worried during an important examination, your heart may beat very fast and you may feel breathless too. You are experiencing stress. Another common situation in which a person is likely to feel stress is to have to do something, for example, performing a boring duty, every day. Let us look at the case of Annie who was a nurse. She felt a lot of stress in her work and began to have very bad headaches at the end of the day. Each morning she woke up more tired than she was when she went to sleep. She did not want to go out in the evening with her friends and she felt unhappy all the time. Finally, she sat down and thought about her life. She saw a lot of illness and death in her work but that was not the reason why she was under stress. The real reason was that she felt unable to make a positive decision in her job - she had to do what the doctors and sisters told her. So, Annie went back to college for further study. When she graduated, she found a job where she was part of a team as before, but where she had responsibility in making decisions. Her working hours were longer and her work more difficult than when she was a nurse but she enjoyed it. She felt she was in control of her life and her work. For Annie, stress in her old job had made her change her life and end a difficult situation. Stress in her new job became a good thing because it helped her achieve satisfaction in her life and in her work.             question:             Feeling   _   is one form of stress.             options:             ['A. tired', 'B. alone', 'C. anxious', 'D. breathless']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the context of the article and identify which feeling is described as a form of stress.
1. The article talks about how stress is a common cause of heart disease and describes some situations where stress is experienced.
2. It describes a scenario: imagining being alone in the house and hearing someone in the kitchen. In this situation, the body reacts by making the heart beat faster and causing difficulty in breathing. Although this scenario initially describes fear, it is noted that the body's reaction is similar in stress.
3. The article further explains that experiencing anxiety and worry during an examination can cause the same physical reactions, reinforcing the idea of stress.
4. When considering the options: 
   - 'A. tired': While tiredness is mentioned in the article in relation to Annie, it is not specifically labeled as a form of stress.
   - 'B. alone': Being alone is part of the scenario but is not directly associated with stress itself.
   - 'C. anxious': The article directly connects worry and anxiety to being a form of stress.
   - 'D. breathless': Breathlessness is a symptom described but not specifically labeled as a form of stress.
Based on the article, the feeling of being "anxious
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. anxious

A: Let's think step by step.
The article states that heart disease kills a lot of women and even more men. This implies that heart disease affects both genders, but more men die from it compared to women. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "According to the passage, _ die of heart disease" would be option:
B. more men than women

A: Let's think step by step.
The passage mentions Annie's experience as a nurse and her feelings during that time. It states that she felt a lot of stress in her job and was unhappy, as evident from her symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and reluctance to socialize. The text specifically highlights that the reason for her stress was "that she felt unable to make a positive decision in her job." This indicates that she lacked control or influence over her work, which ties back to the concept of responsibility. When Annie found a new job with more decision-making power, she felt more in control. Thus, the term that fits best in the blank based on the given context is "D. responsibility." Annie felt no real responsibility in her work or in her life as a nurse.
Answer: D. responsibility

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the major difference between Annie's old and new job, let's analyze the information provided in the text:
1. **Old Job:**
   - Annie worked as a nurse.
   - She experienced high levels of stress.
   - The stress primarily came from her inability to make positive decisions in her role; she had to follow what doctors and senior nurses (sisters) told her.
   - Her work environment did not allow her much responsibility in decision-making.
2. **New Job:**
   - Annie pursued further education and secured a new job after graduation.
   - In her new job, she still worked as part of a team, maintaining the teamwork aspect.
   - The new job involved longer working hours and was more challenging.
   - Importantly, it offered her responsibility in making decisions, which is a key factor that distinguished it from her previous job.
Now, let's review the provided options:
- **A. It included teamwork.** 
  - Teamwork was a part of both her old and new jobs, so this is not a major difference.
  
- **B. It demands higher qualifications.** 
  - While Annie did return to college to gain additional qualifications, the text does not explicitly state that her new job demands higher qualifications as
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. Annie's new job involves decision-making, which was not a component of her old job.

PS12.9', 'B. PS64.5', 'C. PS38.7', 'D. PS77.4']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the total cost for a couple and their 10-year-old boy to take 5 tennis classes, we need to calculate the cost for each of them based on the given information.
1. **Cost for Adults:**
   - The cost for each adult per tennis class is £4.8.
   - Since there are two adults, the cost for both per class is \(2 \times £4.8 = £9.6\).
   - For 5 classes, the total cost for both adults is \(5 \times £9.6 = £48\).
2. **Cost for the Child:**
   - The cost for an under 16-year-old per tennis class is £3.30.
   - For 5 classes, the total cost for the child is \(5 \times £3.30 = £16.5\).
3. **Total Cost:**
   - Combine the costs for the adults and the child to get the total cost for the family.
   - Total cost = \(£48 + £16.5 = £64.5\).
Therefore, the family should pay a total of £64.5 for the 5 tennis classes.
The correct answer is **B. PS64.5**

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option, we need to focus on the activity related to making things with hands. 
- The "Tennis lessons" involve playing tennis and do not involve making things with hands. Contact person is Laura Reynolds.
- The "Street dance classes" focus on dance for young children and do not involve making things with hands. Contact person is Hayley Rea.
- The "Children's workshops in clay" involve making things with clay, which is definitely an activity involving using hands. Contact person is Shirley Stewart.
- The "Caterpillar music" focuses on music and entertainment for young children, which also does not involve making things with hands. Contact person is Angela Capriati.
Therefore, the activity related to making things with hands is the "Children's workshops in clay," and the contact person is Shirley Stewart.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what can be learned about Caterpillar music based on the given article, let's analyze the provided information step by step:
1. **Event Schedule**: The event is scheduled to occur every Tuesday and Friday from October 18 to December 31. This indicates that the event lasts for a little over two months, not four months, so option A is incorrect.
2. **Class Content and Structure**: The classes are designed for children aged 0 to 4 years, utilizing puppets, actions, songs, instruments, and games. The description mentions that these tools are used to entertain and introduce a love of music to children. There is no information stating that the class is personalized or different for each child. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.
3. **Weekly Theme**: The article specifically states that each week the class has a different theme. This directly corroborates option C, which mentions that the theme of the class changes every week.
4. **Purpose of the Event**: While the event does involve instruments, it is part of a broader range of activities. The primary goal mentioned is to entertain and introduce a love of music, rather than specifically teaching how to play different instruments. Thus, option D is not substantiated by the provided information.

He graduated from Harvard University, which sends few players to the NBA, and he is the only Chinese-American NBA player. But when you watch him on the court, there is no doubt that he belongs there. He moves with speed and grace that demonstrate years of faithful practice, which is fueled by a love for basketball. Lin's enjoyment of basketball actually began in Taiwan. When Lin's father moved to U.S., his interest in the sport only grew and he passed on this love of basketball to his son, introducing him to the game at the age of five. The young Lin spent much of his youth playing basketball for fun. In high school, Lin dreamed of playing in the NBA. When he applied for college, he was not offered a single sports scholarship. However, after his admission to Harvard, he was offered a place on its college basketball team. During Lin's time at Harvard, his basketball career began to speed up. He scored 1,482 points, making him one of the highest scorers in Ivy League history. When he graduated, no professional teams offered Lin a contract, but he was invited to play in the NBA Summer League. He played well and ended up eagerly signing a contract with the Golden State Warriors. At first,playing in professional games filled Lin with excitement. He treasured opportunities to meet players he had been watching on TV for years. But slowly, the excitement _ and was replaced by anxiety. In a few very difficult months, he was cut by two teams before the New York Knicks picked him up. But he had the courage and determination to stick to his dream, so he put himself into hard training to get ready for his opportunity to come. Then his moment arrived on February 4, 2012,on which his excellent performance made him famous overnight. After that, he led the Knicks to their fifth straight victory. The Associated Press called Lin "the most surprising story in the NBA". Knicks fans developed the nickname for him "Linsanity"  . Time magazine released its 2012 list of the 100 "Most Influential People in the World", Jeremy Lin included. No doubt, Lin fever is continuing to spread if you haven't already caught "Linsanity", get ready.             question:             Which of the following elements is of little help in Lin's success?             options:             ["A. his father's influence", 'B. his devotion to basketball', 'C. his years of hard work', 'D. his graduation from Harvard University']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which element is of little help in Jeremy Lin's success, we need to evaluate each option based on the context provided in the article.
A. His father's influence: The article mentions that Jeremy Lin's father had a passion for basketball, which he passed on to his son early in his life. This influence helped Jeremy develop a love for the game from the age of five, which is a significant factor in his journey to success. So, his father's influence played a crucial role in his success.
B. His devotion to basketball: The article describes Lin's enjoyment and dedication to basketball, which drove him to practice diligently and pursue a career in the NBA, despite not receiving a sports scholarship initially. His devotion is clearly a key element of his success.
C. His years of hard work: The text highlights Lin's persistent practice and hard work, which helped him perform well in the NBA Summer League and later seize opportunities with the New York Knicks. His determination and hard work were fundamental factors in his eventual breakthrough and success.
D. His graduation from Harvard University: While Harvard provided Lin an opportunity to play college basketball and recognized his talent, the article points out that professional teams did not offer him a contract upon graduation. Instead, it was his participation in the NBA Summer League
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. His graduation from Harvard University

Q: article:             Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to challenge our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they possessed. As a member of that group, you would likely inherit   that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be hesitant to really get behind yourself, fearing that your investment would not pay off. Even if you had the courage to follow your passion, your inner belief that you are not inherently talented would probably be a major drawback to investing your energy in your dream. On the other hand, if you found a way to release that negative belief, a great flood of energy would pour forth, greatly increasing the likelihood of your success. How much energy we are willing to invest in the various ideas, dreams, and visions we carry within is like the money people are, or are not, willing to invest in the various products available for trade on the stock market. And in both cases, belief plays a key role in determining how willing we are to get behind something. One way to open up the possibility for greater success in our inner economies is to understand that belief is not the reliable guide we sometimes think. There are other more reliable things of success that we can put our faith in, such as passion, feeling, and sense. Some of the most successful investors in the stock market are the ones that go against the grain (to be something that one does not like doing), trusting their sense over the common opinion held by common people about what will work. In the same way, we can learn to trust our heart's desires and our sense to guide us, questioning any beliefs that stand in the way of our ability to fully invest in ourselves. As we take out energy from limiting ideas about what is possible, we free up the resources that have the power to make our inner economy prosper.             question:             According to the passage, if a family of origin has passion for literature, the members of the family will probably_.             options:             ['A. teach literature', 'B. hate literature', 'C. write poems', 'D. enter the field of literature']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most likely outcome for the family members based on their passion for literature, we can analyze how beliefs and attitudes are portrayed in the passage. The passage discusses how individuals often inherit beliefs from their family of origin and how these beliefs can influence their aspirations or perceived potential.
The key points from the passage are:
- Beliefs inherited from the family can significantly impact a person's willingness to pursue certain paths.
- If negative beliefs are challenged or released, individuals can harness more energy and passion towards their dreams.
- Belief in one's capability plays a crucial role in the pursuit of dreams.
In the scenario where a family has a passion for literature, it is reasonable to infer that this positive belief or attitude towards literature allows family members to feel more confident and open to pursuing endeavors related to literature. Therefore, they are more likely to invest their energy in fields related to their passion.
Evaluating the options provided:
- Option A: "teach literature" implies involvement and sharing of their passion but does not encompass all possibilities related to having a passion for literature.
- Option B: "hate literature" directly contradicts having a passion for literature.
- Option C: "write poems" is specific and possible but doesn’t capture the broader implication of pursuing something related to literature.
- Option D
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. enter the field of literature'

A: Let's think step by step.
To address the question, we need to identify which of the given options cannot be considered as a thing of success in the context of the article. The article discusses concepts such as passion, feeling, and sense as more reliable guides than belief for success in our inner economies.
- **A. Passion**: The article mentions passion as one of the "more reliable things of success."
- **B. Feeling**: Similarly, feeling is identified as a more reliable guide for success.
- **C. Sense**: This is also listed as something in which we can put our faith for success.
- **D. Stock market**: The article uses the stock market as a metaphor for belief and investment but does not mention it as a thing of success to put faith in our inner economies.
Given this analysis, the correct answer is 'D. stock market' since it is not highlighted as a thing to put faith in for success in the context of personal beliefs and inner economy.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. stock market'

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the purpose of the author, let's closely examine key points in the article and align them with the provided options.
1. **Main Idea**: The article uses the metaphor of the stock market to explain how our beliefs influence our potential for success, or our "inner economy." The author suggests that challenges to our belief systems and releasing negative beliefs can unlock energy and potential within us. This is compared to how investors might choose to support certain stock market commodities.
2. **Belief's Role**: The article emphasizes that beliefs about personal ability, like in musical talent, can hold someone back unless challenged. The suggestion is to release these negative beliefs and invest energy more freely in our passions and desires.
3. **Investment in Oneself vs. Stock Market**: While there is a comparison made to the stock market, the true focus is on the personal internal investment rather than monetary investment in stocks.
4. **Reliable Guides**: The article suggests that passion, feeling, and personal sense might be more reliable guides to success than our traditional beliefs.
5. **Encouragement and Guidance**: The article essentially encourages individuals to question self-limiting beliefs and invest in personal dreams and passions.
Now, aligning the main points with the options:
- **A.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.**

The author is giving useful suggestions on how to invest in ourselves by challenging our limiting beliefs and trusting our passions and senses.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when the passage was probably written, we need to examine the content and context provided within the passage. The passage mentions several key points:
1. **Christmas Context**: The passage talks about starting Zero Waste practices at Christmas and suggests ideas for a Zero Waste Christmas, like sending recyclable cards and using a real tree that can be replanted.
2. **Encouragement for Change**: The passage encourages people to reconsider their waste habits, implying that the Zero Waste movement is still something that requires promotion and change in habits.
3. **Lack of Established Norms**: Since the passage talks about Zero Waste as something that needs to be deliberately worked towards and mentions the inconvenience some people feel about it, it suggests that the practice is not yet widely adopted or popular.
Based on these points, the passage is likely written in preparation for Christmas, emphasizing a shift in behavior and habits before the holiday arrives. The encouragement to implement Zero Waste during Christmas indicates it's written before the holiday to prompt action.
Given these considerations, the best option is:
**C. Before a Christmas.**

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most appropriate action to reduce waste according to the passage, let's analyze each option in the context of the information provided:
- **Option A: To stop using plastic bottles or even PCs.**  
  The passage mentions the problem of plastic bottles and PCs ending up in rubbish bins, but it does not specifically advocate for stopping their use entirely. Instead, it emphasizes designing products that are more easily repaired, reused, and recycled.
- **Option B: To create more things that can be repaired quickly.**  
  While the idea of designing products that can be repaired is mentioned, the emphasis in the passage is on designing products that can be "more easily repaired, reused, and recycled." Therefore, this option partially aligns with the message but doesn't fully capture the overall recommendation.
- **Option C: To avoid sending cards on Christmas.**  
  The passage suggests sending recyclable cards as a way to reduce waste, but it does not advocate avoiding sending cards entirely. This option does not align with the suggestions provided.
- **Option D: To copy the way Nature wastes nothing.**  
  The passage opens with the recommendation to "copy the way Nature wastes nothing" as part of the process of going zero waste. This is a broader concept that encompasses various strategies
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is **D.**

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is not aligned with living a Zero Waste life, we need to analyze each option based on the principles mentioned in the article.
1. **A. Taking no more than we need**: The article mentions this as a key practice of people who live Zero Waste lives. It emphasizes being careful about consumption.
2. **B. Reusing plastic bags**: The article specifically states that reusing plastic bags at supermarkets is a great way to reduce waste, thus aligning with Zero Waste practices.
3. **C. Not going food shopping when we're hungry**: The article advises against going food shopping when hungry to avoid buying too much, which leads to waste. Therefore, this practice supports a Zero Waste lifestyle.
4. **D. Not making a plan before we shop**: The article suggests that those who plan before they shop can avoid throwing food out later, indicating that planning is important to minimize waste.
Given this analysis, the action that is not aligned with living Zero Waste is:
**D. not making a plan before we shop**
As making a plan before shopping helps reduce waste, not doing so is counter to the Zero Waste lifestyle principles mentioned in the article.

Q: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: "R U awake?" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. " If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. " It' s a matter of balance," says Olson." You've got to work on it. " Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. "It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, " says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. " Kids should try," adds Rideout. " But parents might have to step in sometimes. "             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option:
1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.**
   - The article mentions a "huge explosion in mobile devices" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them.
2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.**
   - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement.
3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.**
   - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past.
4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.**
   - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A.

Q: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: "R U awake?" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. " If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. " It' s a matter of balance," says Olson." You've got to work on it. " Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. "It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, " says Rideout.

Cheryl Olson is not surprised about kids' increasing use of mobile devices", 'D. most experts think teenagers should not use electronic devices for their studies']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the passage and determine which of the provided options are supported by the information within it. Let's examine each option one by one:
Option A: "Brandon Blanco feels very annoyed about his late-night text."
- The article mentions that Brandon was woken up by a loud noise and then reached for his cell phone, seeing a message asking if he was awake. However, there is no mention of Brandon feeling annoyed about this message, so this option is not supported by the passage.
Option B: "The teenagers using mobile devices have increased by 30% in the past five years."
- The passage states that today nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones, compared to five years ago when it was four out of ten. This represents an increase, but not exactly a 30% increase. The math would show an increase from 40% to 70%, which is a 30 percentage point increase, but the passage does not explicitly state the exact percentage increase. This option is somewhat misleading and not directly supported.
Option C: "Cheryl Olson is not surprised about kids' increasing use of mobile devices."
- The passage includes a quote from media expert Cheryl Olson, "If you've got a chance to do something on your
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

"             question:             Which of the following is an example of multitasking according to the passage?             options:             ['A. Watching TV while using the computer.', 'B. Talking on the phone while staying with others.', 'C. Playing video games on the Internet.', 'D. Listening to music while relaxing.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage defines multitasking as using more than one electronic device at the same time. It provides an example saying, "If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?" This means multitasking involves engaging with multiple devices or performing multiple tasks simultaneously.
Now, let's evaluate each option to determine which one fits the definition of multitasking from the passage:
- **A. Watching TV while using the computer.**
  - This option involves using more than one device simultaneously (TV and computer), which fits the definition of multitasking.
- **B. Talking on the phone while staying with others.**
  - This option involves doing an activity (talking on the phone) while in the presence of others, but it doesn't specify using more than one device simultaneously. It is more about social interaction than multitasking with electronic devices.
- **C. Playing video games on the Internet.**
  - This option involves using one device to play games online, but it doesn’t involve using multiple devices simultaneously.
- **D. Listening to music while relaxing.**
  - This option implies performing a single task with or without a device, which doesn't fit the multitasking definition as described in the passage

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option Victoria Rideout would probably agree with, let's analyze the key points from the passage:
1. **Background on Study**: The passage cites a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, with Rideout as the lead author, indicating that kids aged 8 to 18 are spending more time using electronic devices—about seven and a half hours a day on average.
2. **Multitasking**: Rideout is concerned about multitasking while doing homework. She emphasizes the importance of being able to stop and concentrate on one thing deeply.
3. **Interpreting Rideout's Opinion**:
   - She highlights the issue of children not concentrating deeply due to multitasking, which implies that studying in a focused environment is essential.
   - She doesn't mention anything about kids needing more homework or specifically needing to spend more time on homework.
   - The concern is more about the quality of homework time—doing it without the distraction of multiple devices.
Based on this analysis, the key concern for Rideout seems to be the distractions from technology. Therefore, she would likely agree that:
**B. kids should do homework in a place without disturbance**
This aligns with her concern that kids need to be able to concentrate deeply on one task, such as homework, without

Q: article:             American researchers say drinking tea may help strengthen the body's defense system against infection. Doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, did the study. The team studied a chemical found in black, green, oolong and pekoe tea. This chemical is an amino acid called L-theanine. The scientists say it may increase the strength of gamma delta T cells. That's the letter T, not the drink. Gamma delta T cells are part of the body's defense. First, the researchers mixed some of these cells with antigens found in the amino acid . Antigens help the body react to infection. Then the scientists added some bacteria. Within twenty-four hours, the cells produced a lot of interferon, a substance that fights infection. Cells not mixed with the antigens did not produce interferon. In the second part of the study, eleven people drank five to six cups of black tea every day. Ten other people drank the same amount of instant coffee. That is dried coffee mixed with hot water. Two weeks later, and again two weeks after that, the researchers tested the blood of all twenty-one people. They also looked at what happened when they added bacteria to the blood cells. They found that the tea drinkers produced five times more interferon after they started drinking tea. The coffee drinkers did not produce interferon. Doctor Jack Bukowski led the study. He says the antigens added to the gamma delta T cells were responsible for the increased reaction to the bacteria. He says that the study also showed that the cells were able to remember the bacteria and fight them again the next time. Earlier research already has found that tea can help prevent heart disease and cancer. Doctor Bukowski says the new study must be repeated by more people. "If the findings prove to be true," he says, "then tea drinking might also help protect against bacterial infections." He says the amino acid L-theanine could be removed from the tea and used as a drug to strengthen the body's defenses.             question:             We may know from the text that   _   can be found in different kinds of tea.             options:             ['A. L-theanine', 'B. Gamma delta T cells', 'C. interferon', 'D. bacteria']
A: Let's think step by step.
The text discusses a study conducted by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston regarding the effects of drinking tea. The study focuses specifically on a chemical found in different types of tea, including black, green, oolong, and pekoe tea. This chemical is identified in the text as an amino acid called L-theanine. 
The study explores how L-theanine may increase the strength of gamma delta T cells, which are part of the body's defense system. It also describes experiments that involved mixing gamma delta T cells with antigens found in L-theanine and observing the cells' reaction to bacteria. The researchers found that cells with antigens produced more interferon, a substance that fights infection, compared to cells without antigens.
The text also mentions that participants who drank tea had an increased production of interferon, while coffee drinkers did not, suggesting a potential link between tea consumption and increased resistance to bacterial infections.
When analyzing the options given for the answer to the question: "We may know from the text that _ can be found in different kinds of tea," it is clear from the text that L-theanine is the chemical mentioned as being found in different kinds of tea (black, green, oolong, and pekoe).
Therefore, the answer is:

Q: article:             A subject which seems to have been insufficiently studied by doctors and psychologists is the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of mankind. There seems no doubt that the general character of the landscape, the relative length of day and night, and the climate must all play a big part in determining what kind of people we are. It is true that a few studies have been made. Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply, or perhaps types of land that provide breeding places for pests like mosquitoes or rats. Moreover, we can all generalize about types of people we have met. Those living in countries with long dark winters are apt to be less talkative and less vivacious than inhabitants of countries where the climate is more equable. And where the olive and the orange grow, there the inhabitants are cheerful, talkative, and spontaneous. But these commonplace generalizations are inadequate: the influence of climate and geography should be studied in depth. Do all mountain dwellers live to a ripe old age? Does the drinking of wine, rather than beer, result in a sunny and open temperament? Is the strength and height of one of the Kenyan tribes due to their habitual drinking of the blood of cows? We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies.             question:             _   might serve as a suitable title for this selection.             options:             ['A. The Importance of Geographical Environment', 'B. The Influence of Geographical Environment on Man', 'C. Generalization of Types of People', 'D. Geographical Environment, a Mysterious Subject']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most suitable title for the article, we should first identify the main theme or focus of the article. The article discusses the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of humans. It highlights that although some studies have been conducted, much remains to be explored in this area. The article also mentions various factors like landscape, climate, and the presence of certain substances in the environment that could affect health and personality. 
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **A. The Importance of Geographical Environment**: This option emphasizes the significance of the geographical environment but doesn't fully capture the article's focus on its specific influence on humans.
- **B. The Influence of Geographical Environment on Man**: This option directly aligns with the main theme of the article, which centers on how geographical and climatic factors may influence human health and characteristics. 
- **C. Generalization of Types of People**: This title focuses on generalizations about people from different regions, but the article goes beyond just generalizations to discuss the potential reasons behind these differences.
- **D. Geographical Environment, a Mysterious Subject**: This suggests a lack of understanding or clarity, which is touched upon in the article, but it doesn't emphasize the aspect of influence on humans

We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies.             question:             Using context clues we may infer that " iodine, fluoride and calcium" are   _  .             options:             ["A. substances which act positively or negatively on man's health", 'B. harmful substances in the water supply', 'C. substances which help provide breeding places for pests', 'D. substances contributory to good health']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct inference about "iodine, fluoride, and calcium" in the context of the article, we need to focus on how the article discusses these substances in relation to health.
1. **Contextual Reference**: The article mentions that scientists have identified substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply as "contributory factors" where the health of the inhabitants is exceptionally good or bad.
2. **Understanding "Contributory Factors"**: The phrase suggests that these substances have effects on health, either positive or negative, depending on their presence or absence in the environment.
3. **Eliminating Options**:
   - **Option B (Harmful substances in the water supply)**: This option assumes that these substances are negative, which is not supported by the text. These substances can have beneficial effects as well (like fluoride in preventing tooth decay).
   - **Option C (Substances which help provide breeding places for pests)**: This is irrelevant to the context since the passage does not link these substances to breeding places for pests but rather to human health.
   - **Option D (Substances contributory to good health)**: This implies that these substances are only beneficial. However, the context indicates they can influence

Q: article:             A subject which seems to have been insufficiently studied by doctors and psychologists is the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of mankind. There seems no doubt that the general character of the landscape, the relative length of day and night, and the climate must all play a big part in determining what kind of people we are. It is true that a few studies have been made. Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply, or perhaps types of land that provide breeding places for pests like mosquitoes or rats. Moreover, we can all generalize about types of people we have met. Those living in countries with long dark winters are apt to be less talkative and less vivacious than inhabitants of countries where the climate is more equable. And where the olive and the orange grow, there the inhabitants are cheerful, talkative, and spontaneous. But these commonplace generalizations are inadequate: the influence of climate and geography should be studied in depth. Do all mountain dwellers live to a ripe old age? Does the drinking of wine, rather than beer, result in a sunny and open temperament? Is the strength and height of one of the Kenyan tribes due to their habitual drinking of the blood of cows? We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies.             question:             According to the author, research into the influence of geography and climate should  _  .             options:             ['A. focus on some unknown aspects', 'B. be pursued on a larger scale', 'C. be carried out within a larger scope', 'D. go much deeper']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we need to examine the article and the question carefully to understand what the author is suggesting about the research into the influence of geography and climate.
1. **Understand the Main Point**: The article highlights that while some studies have been conducted on how geography and climate affect health and character, these studies are not sufficient. The author believes that the influence of geography and climate on psychological and physical health should be studied more thoroughly.
2. **Identify what the Author is Suggesting**: The author discusses commonplace generalizations and suggests that these are inadequate. Specifically, the author calls for a more in-depth study of the influence of climate and geography.
3. **Evaluate the Options**:
   - **A. focus on some unknown aspects**: Although the author mentions "unknown" factors to some extent, the emphasis is not on focusing on unknown aspects but rather studying the influence more thoroughly.
   - **B. be pursued on a larger scale**: This suggests increasing the number of studies or participants, but the author's emphasis is more on depth rather than breadth.
   - **C. be carried out within a larger scope**: This also implies a broader study, which is not the primary recommendation of the author.
   - **D. go much deeper
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D'.

We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies.             question:             The author hopes that studies on the influence of geographical environment will enable us to  _             options:             ['A. generalize better about types of people', 'B. find better water supplies', 'C. gain an insight into its influence on mankind', 'D. live to a ripe old age']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option with respect to the content of the article:
1. **Option A: Generalize better about types of people**
   - The article mentions generalizations about people from different climates, but the author implies that such generalizations are currently insufficient and calls for deeper studies. The author's goal appears to be more comprehensive than merely improving generalizations.
2. **Option B: Find better water supplies**
   - The article talks about certain health factors related to water supply but does not suggest that finding better water supplies is the main goal of studying geographical influences.
3. **Option C: Gain an insight into its influence on mankind**
   - The article discusses studying the influence of geography and climate on both psychological and physical health, indicating a desire to understand these influences more deeply. The hope for studies to result in ‘something of benefit to mankind’ aligns well with gaining insights for broader understanding.
4. **Option D: Live to a ripe old age**
   - Although there is a mention of mountain dwellers living to a ripe old age, the article does not suggest this as the primary aim of studying geographical influences.
Given the above evaluations, option C ("gain an insight into its influence on mankind") fits best with the author's expressed hope
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

Q: article:             "Children who eat less salt and drink fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks may significantly lower their risks of obesity," researchers recently reported in the journal Hypertension. "Sugar-sweetened soft drinks are a significant source of calorie intake in children," said Feng J. He, a researcher at St George's University of London, England. "It has been shown that sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption is related to obesity in young people." They wanted to know whether there is a link between salt intake and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption. Dr He and colleagues analyzed data from a 1997 national survey of more than 2,000 people between 4 and 18 in Britain. "We found that children eating a lower-salt diet drank less fluid," said He. "From our research, we estimated that 1 gram of salt cut from their daily diet would reduce fluid intake by 100 grams per day." The researchers also found that children eating a lower-salt diet drank fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks. From their research, they predicted that reducing salt intake by 1 gram each day would reduce sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption by 27 grams per day, after. "If children aged 4 to 18 cut their salt intake by half, there would be a decrease of about two sugar-sweetened soft drinks per week per child, so each child would decrease calorie intake by almost 250 kilocalories per week," Dr He said. In previous studies, researchers found that a low-salt diet lowers blood pressure in children, and prevents the development of high blood pressure later in life. "Both high blood pressure and obesity increase the risk of having strokes and heart attacks," Dr He said. Dr He recommends that parents check labels and choose low-salt food products. "Small reductions in the salt content of 10 to 20 percent cannot be detected by the human salt taste receptors   and do not cause any technological or safety problems," Dr He said.             question:             According to the passage, obesity is directly linked to   _  .             options:             ['A. high-salt foods', 'B. sugar-sweetened soft drinks', 'C. high blood pressure', 'D. strokes and heart attacks']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer to the question regarding what obesity is directly linked to according to the passage, we need to examine the information presented.
1. The passage highlights the research findings that "Children who eat less salt and drink fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks may significantly lower their risks of obesity." This indicates a link between sugar-sweetened soft drinks and obesity.
2. The passage mentions that "Sugar-sweetened soft drinks are a significant source of calorie intake in children" and that "sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption is related to obesity in young people." This further establishes the connection between sugar-sweetened soft drinks and obesity.
3. Additionally, while the passage discusses salt intake's relationship with overall fluid consumption and its indirect effect through fluid and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption, it does not directly relate high-salt foods to obesity without considering sugar-sweetened soft drinks.
4. High blood pressure and strokes and heart attacks are discussed as health risks but in the context of blood pressure issues rather than obesity.
Given these points, the passage directly links obesity to the consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks.
Thus, the correct answer is:
B. sugar-sweetened soft drinks
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, let's break down the information we have:
1. **Previous Studies Findings**: Previous studies mentioned in the article showed that a low-salt diet can lower blood pressure in children and prevent the development of high blood pressure later in life. This is connected to decreased risks of strokes and heart attacks.
2. **Recent Study Findings**: The recent study explored the relationship between salt intake and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption. The researchers discovered that children with lower salt intake also drank fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks. This finding indirectly suggests that reducing salt intake might contribute to lowering obesity risk by reducing calorie intake from sugary drinks.
Now let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A**: This states that the recent study found a lower-salt diet may mean less sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption. This directly corresponds with the new findings of the recent study as discussed in the article.
  
- **Option B**: This is aligned with the previous study's findings rather than the recent one.
  
- **Option C**: This is a general risk associated with high blood pressure but not a specific new finding from the recent study.
  
- **Option D**: This discusses low-salt food products in general but doesn't relate directly to the findings
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A.

The less salt people eat, the healthier people become.', 'B. Children should reduce fluid intake in their daily life.', 'C. No high-salt food products will be available in shops.', 'D. A low-salt diet may prevent both high blood pressure and obesity.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement Dr. He would agree with, we need to consider the key findings and recommendations presented in the article:
1. Children who eat less salt are found to consume fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which can lead to reduced risks of obesity. 
2. A lower-salt diet also helps in reducing fluid intake, particularly sugar-sweetened soft drinks.
3. Previous studies found that a low-salt diet helps lower blood pressure in children and prevent high blood pressure later in life.
4. Both high blood pressure and obesity increase the risk of strokes and heart attacks, and a low-salt diet may contribute to preventing these conditions.
Now, let's evaluate each option:
- **Option A**: "The less salt people eat, the healthier people become." While it's true that reducing salt can have positive health effects, such as reducing the risk of high blood pressure and obesity, saying it makes people generally healthier might be too broad since overall health depends on various factors.
- **Option B**: "Children should reduce fluid intake in their daily life." The emphasis of Dr. He's findings is not on reducing fluid intake overall but specifically on sugar-sweetened soft drinks. General fluid intake, like water, is essential for health.
- **Option C
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. A low-salt diet may prevent both high blood pressure and obesity.

Children.', 'B. Parents.', 'C. Doctors.', 'D. Researchers.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage focuses on the effects of salt and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption on children's health, specifically concerning obesity and blood pressure. It discusses the findings of a research study which suggests that reducing salt intake can lead to a decrease in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and consequently lower the risk of obesity and high blood pressure. 
The passage emphasizes that salt reduction can be achieved through making informed choices about food products with lower salt content. Dr. He, one of the researchers involved in the study, directly recommends that parents check food labels and opt for low-salt products. 
The reason for this recommendation is that parents are typically responsible for purchasing and preparing food for their children, especially within the age group mentioned in the study (4 to 18 years old). Therefore, they are in the best position to make changes in dietary habits that could benefit their children's health.
While children and doctors play roles in health outcomes, the passage specifically highlights the responsibility of parents in making food choices. Researchers have conducted the study and provided recommendations, but it is the parents who need to implement these changes in a practical sense.
Given this analysis, the correct answer is:
B. Parents.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B

Q: article:             Like every language, American English is full of special expressions, phrases that come from the day-to-day life of the people and develop in their own way. Our expression today is "to face the music". When someone says, "Well, I guess I'll have to face the music," it does not mean he's planning to go to the concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you didn't do this or that. Awful music indeed, but it has to be faced. At sometime or another, every one of us has to face the music, especially as children. We can all remember father's angry voice, "I want to talk to you." and only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was! The phrase "to face the music" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. And where did this expression come from? The first explanation comes from the American novelist, James Fenimore Looper. He said, in 1851, that the expression was first used by actors while waiting to go on the stage. When they got their cue  to go on, they often said, "Well, it's time to face the music." And that was exactly what they did--facing the orchestra  which was just below them. And an actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of an audience that might be friendly or perhaps _ , especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. If he did not, there would be no play. So the expression "to face the music" came to mean "having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice." Other explanations about the expression go back to the army. When the men faced an inspection  by their leader, the soldiers would be worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean, shiny enough to pass the inspection? Still the men had to go out and face the music of the band as well as the inspection. What else could they do? Another army explanation is more closely linked to the idea of facing the results and accepting the responsibility for something that should not have been done. For example, when a man is forced out of the army because he did something terrible, he is dishonored. The band does not play. Only the drums tap a sad, slow beat. The soldier is forced to leave, facing such music as it is and facing the back of his horse.             question:             How many ways does the phrase "to face the music" comes from?             options:             ['A. 1.', 'B. 2.', 'C. 3.', 'D. 4.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The phrase "to face the music" is explained in the article with three potential origins:
1. From the theater: Actors, before going on stage, used the phrase as they faced the orchestra pit, and thus, the music.
2. From an army inspection: Soldiers faced the music of the band during an inspection by their leader, worrying about the cleanliness and readiness of their equipment.
3. From a disciplinary context in the army: When a soldier is dishonorably discharged and forced to leave, they face the solemn music of drums.
Therefore, there are 3 ways the phrase "to face the music" might have originated. The correct option is:
C. 3.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

To face something far less pleasant.', 'B. To face the stage.', "C. To face the back of one's horse.", "D. To face one's leader."]
A: Let's think step by step.
The phrase "to face the music" is explained in the article as having to go through an unpleasant experience or situation because there is no choice but to confront it. This is illustrated by examples involving actors who must go on stage regardless of their nerves or potential mistakes, and soldiers who must face inspections or consequences for their actions. The phrase is used to signify confronting a difficult or unpleasant reality, not something literal like facing a stage, a horse, or a leader specifically. Therefore, the best choice among the given options is:
A. To face something far less pleasant.

Q: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread." To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']
A: Let's think step by step.
To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions.
1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness.
2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance ("In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life.
3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own.
- **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread." To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             What is implied in the passage by the writer?             options:             ['A. To use wealth properly,eat,drink and be merry.', 'B. Where there is a will,there is a wav.', 'C. As life is but like a dream,a man is like a fruit tree.', 'D. If you cease to struggle,you cease to live.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the implication in the passage, we need to analyze the main ideas and themes that the writer is conveying.
1. **Acquisition and Use of Wealth**: The passage begins by stating that acquiring wealth through honest means and learning how to use it properly are difficult tasks.
2. **Example of Wealthy Men**: The writer describes a scene in a golf club where older, wealthy men drink aimlessly. Despite their material prosperity, they seem unhappy, as they rely on alcohol to escape their realities.
3. **Productivity and Life**: The writer makes an analogy between a fruit tree ceasing to bear fruit and a person's life losing productivity and purpose, suggesting that there is a link between productivity and a fulfilling life.
4. **Biblical and Personal Inspiration**: The passage references the Bible, specifically Genesis, and St. Paul's words, which have inspired the writer to view life as a challenge that requires continuous effort and perseverance.
From these observations, we can infer that the writer believes that merely having wealth is not sufficient for happiness. Instead, a fulfilling life requires continuous struggle, productivity, and engagement with life challenges.
Now let's evaluate the options:
- **A. To use wealth properly, eat, drink and be merry.**: This option contradict
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. If you cease to struggle, you cease to live.

To determine what is NOT necessary for the three trips, we need to examine the equipment and requirements mentioned for each trip:
1. **Good walking shoes** - This is mentioned as necessary under "Equipment to be needed," specifying no high heels. So, it is necessary for all trips.
2. **A pair of glasses** - This is specifically mentioned for the Flashlight Adventure, likely for clear visibility at night. Thus, it's necessary for that particular trip.
3. **Food and water** - It is stated to bring enough water and food for all walks. Therefore, they are necessary for each trip.
4. **A sleeping bag** - A sleeping bag is not mentioned in any part of the information provided for any of the trips. 
Given this analysis, the item that is NOT necessary for the three trips is:
D. A sleeping bag.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is **D**

Adventure Travel in America', 'B. Hunting around the Great Mountains', 'C. Discovery Trips in the Blue Mountains', 'D. Interesting Trips in the East of the USA']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, let's examine the content and purpose of the article:
1. The passage describes three different trips in the Blue Mountains:
   - Trip 1: Black Bear Count, focusing on counting black bears after recent fires.
   - Trip 2: Garland Valley, a walk aimed at bird-lovers to see wild animals and rare birds.
   - Trip 3: Flashlight Adventure, a night walk to observe nocturnal animals.
2. The passage emphasizes the natural setting (the Blue Mountains), the opportunities for observing wildlife, and the different types of trips available (day and night).
3. The main focus is on exploration and discovery in the context of nature and wildlife in the Blue Mountains, which are part of a National Park.
Now, let's consider the options:
- Option A: "Adventure Travel in America" is too broad and doesn't specifically capture the focus on the Blue Mountains or the nature-oriented aspect of the trips.
- Option B: "Hunting around the Great Mountains" is misleading because the trips are about observing, not hunting.
- Option C: "Discovery Trips in the Blue Mountains" accurately reflects the nature of the described excursions, focusing on discovery and exploration in the Blue Mountains.
- Option D: "Interesting Trips

A: Let's think step by step.
From the article, we know that Ternang has been experiencing continuous heavy rain for six days, resulting in severe flooding. The flooding has already made more than 10,000 people homeless and has swept away a wooden bridge. The town is currently cut off by floodwaters, and areas of the town are underwater, indicating significant and ongoing flooding issues.
1. "It is still raining heavily at Ternang." - This implies that the rainfall is not letting up, which could further exacerbate the flooding situation.
2. "The whole town is expected to be totally covered." - This refers to the expectation that the flooding will cover the town entirely.
3. "So far nobody has been reported dead." - While this indicates no fatalities yet, the primary focus is on the spread and severity of the flooding itself.
Based on these observations, the flood is expected to worsen as heavy rain continues, potentially covering the entire town. Therefore, the most logical outcome expected from the flood is that it will get worse.
So, the answer is C. get worse.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

Q: article:             You've probably heard of Marco Polo, but how much do you actually know about him and his incredible journey? Marco was the original travel writer, whose trade contacts with Asia changed Europe, opening it up to new ideas and cultures. Marco Polo was born in the Venetian Republic around 1254.At the time, Venice was one of the most powerful trading cities in the world, and was ruled as an independent city state.Marco's mother died when he was young, so he was brought up by his aunt and uncle.When Marco was born, his brother (Maffeo) and father (Niccolo), who were successful merchants, were away on a trading voyage.They didn't get back until Marco was about 15. In 1271, Niccolo and Maffeo set off again for Asia, this time taking Marco with them.On a previous journey they'd met Kublai Khan (the Yuan Dynasty), and they were keen to establish trade links between Kublai's empire and Venice.The Polos sailed across the Mediterranean to Acre (now in northern Israel).Then, they traveled by camel to the port of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.Their plan was to sail to China but they couldn't find any good boats.So, they continued the journey overland, finally meeting Kublai Khan at his summer palace in Xanadu, about 275 kms north of modern Beijing.Marco was now probably 21 years ol The journey had taken over three years. The Polos had learnt a great deal about the world during their travels and so Kublai employed Marco as a government official.This gave Marco the opportunity to travel around much of Kublai's empire in China.In fact, Kublai found the Polos so useful that he was unwilling to let them return home.However, in 1292, the Polos eventually left, sailing from China and ending up in Hormuz again.The journey was extremely dangerous: of the 600 travelers who set off, only 18 arrived in Hormuz, including all three of the Polo family. The Polos finally returned to Venice in 1295, twenty-four years after setting off.They had traveled 24,000 kms.By this time Venice was at war with Genoa, its trade rival.Unfortunately for Marco, he was captured by the Genoese and imprisione However, he used his time as a prisoner to write a book about his family's travels: II Milione (known as The Travels of Marco Polo in English).It was the first book to tell Europeans about China and the East.No original copy survives, but there are several versions of it.Marco's writings influenced many other travelers, most notably Christopher Columbus, who carried a copy of II Milione with him on his voyage in search of Asia. After his release from prison in 1299, Marco rejoined his father and uncle in Venice.The family were now even wealthier than before thanks to the many treasures they'd brought back from the East.Marco financed many more trading journeys but never left the city again.He died in 1324 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice.             question:             Which of the following is true according to the passage?             options:             ["A. Soon after his mother's death, Marco was raised by his father.", 'B. Marco spent about six years on the way to China and back to Venice.', 'C. Marco died at the age of 70 in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice.', 'D. Marco was born into a very poor family but died in wealth.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option according to the passage, let's analyze each statement:
A. "Soon after his mother's death, Marco was raised by his father."
- The passage states that after Marco's mother died, he was raised by his aunt and uncle, not his father. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
B. "Marco spent about six years on the way to China and back to Venice."
- According to the passage, Marco and his family set off for Asia in 1271 and returned to Venice in 1295. The journey to China with the Polos' initial meeting with Kublai Khan took a little over three years, and they stayed in China for some time before beginning their return journey, which included another long and arduous trip. Therefore, the total time spent on the journey to China and back to Venice was considerably more than six years. This option is also incorrect.
C. "Marco died at the age of 70 in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice."
- The passage states Marco was born around 1254 and died in 1324. This would mean he lived to be about 70 years old, but it does not say he died in the church of San Lorenzo, only that he was buried there. While the correct age

Q: article:             You've probably heard of Marco Polo, but how much do you actually know about him and his incredible journey? Marco was the original travel writer, whose trade contacts with Asia changed Europe, opening it up to new ideas and cultures. Marco Polo was born in the Venetian Republic around 1254.At the time, Venice was one of the most powerful trading cities in the world, and was ruled as an independent city state.Marco's mother died when he was young, so he was brought up by his aunt and uncle.When Marco was born, his brother (Maffeo) and father (Niccolo), who were successful merchants, were away on a trading voyage.They didn't get back until Marco was about 15. In 1271, Niccolo and Maffeo set off again for Asia, this time taking Marco with them.On a previous journey they'd met Kublai Khan (the Yuan Dynasty), and they were keen to establish trade links between Kublai's empire and Venice.The Polos sailed across the Mediterranean to Acre (now in northern Israel).Then, they traveled by camel to the port of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.Their plan was to sail to China but they couldn't find any good boats.So, they continued the journey overland, finally meeting Kublai Khan at his summer palace in Xanadu, about 275 kms north of modern Beijing.Marco was now probably 21 years ol The journey had taken over three years. The Polos had learnt a great deal about the world during their travels and so Kublai employed Marco as a government official.This gave Marco the opportunity to travel around much of Kublai's empire in China.In fact, Kublai found the Polos so useful that he was unwilling to let them return home.However, in 1292, the Polos eventually left, sailing from China and ending up in Hormuz again.The journey was extremely dangerous: of the 600 travelers who set off, only 18 arrived in Hormuz, including all three of the Polo family. The Polos finally returned to Venice in 1295, twenty-four years after setting off.They had traveled 24,000 kms.By this time Venice was at war with Genoa, its trade rival.Unfortunately for Marco, he was captured by the Genoese and imprisione However, he used his time as a prisoner to write a book about his family's travels: II Milione (known as The Travels of Marco Polo in English).It was the first book to tell Europeans about China and the East.No original copy survives, but there are several versions of it.Marco's writings influenced many other travelers, most notably Christopher Columbus, who carried a copy of II Milione with him on his voyage in search of Asia. After his release from prison in 1299, Marco rejoined his father and uncle in Venice.The family were now even wealthier than before thanks to the many treasures they'd brought back from the East.Marco financed many more trading journeys but never left the city again.He died in 1324 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice.             question:             The passage is most probably taken from   _  .             options:             ['A. a newspaper', 'B. a geography book', 'C. a history book', "D. a traveler's guide"]
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the passage is most probably taken from, let's examine its content closely:
1. **Subject Matter**: The passage discusses the historical figure Marco Polo, his travels, and their significance. It provides a narrative spanning his birth, travels, and eventual death, emphasizing his influence on European knowledge of Asia.
2. **Historical Context**: The passage contains details about historical events and figures, such as Kublai Khan, the Venetian Republic, and the wars between Venice and Genoa. These elements are typically explored in history-focused texts.
3. **Educational Tone**: The passage provides a detailed account of Marco Polo’s travels, offering insights into cultural and historical contexts and appealing to a reader seeking knowledge, which is suitable for an educational or informative book.
4. **Exclusion of Other Options**:
   - **A. a newspaper**: Newspapers are current and time-sensitive, reporting on recent events, not historical stories in such depth.
   - **B. a geography book**: While geography books might mention famous travelers, the detailed historical narrative and the focus on Marco Polo’s life journey rather than specific geographical features make this less likely.
   - **D. a traveler's guide**: This would focus on contemporary travel advice and destinations, not historical

Q: article:             Finding time to read is an important part of developing reading and writing skills for all kids. And there are many easy and convenient ways to make reading a part of each day -- even when it's tough to find time to sit down with a book. Car trips, waits in checkout lines and the doctor's office are all opportunities for reading. Keep books or magazines in your car, or backpack to pull out whenever you're going to be in one place for a while. Even if you can't finish a book, read a few pages or discuss some of the pictures. Encourage kids to bring favorite books and magazines along wherever you go. While it's attractive to provide electronic games and readers, be sure to alternate electronic media with plenty of opportunities to read traditional print books. Reading opportunities are everywhere you go. While riding in the car, for example, encourage kids to spot words and letters (on billboards, store signs, etc.), turning it into a game ("Who'll be the first to find a letter B?"). Even daily tasks like cooking can provide reading moments. Kids can assist you as you cook by telling you how much flour to measure. Give your child a catalogue to read while you sort through the mail. Ask relatives to send your child letters, e-mail, or text messages, and read them together. Help your child create letters or messages to send back to the relatives. These types of activities help kids see the purpose of reading and of print. Even when you're trying to get things done, you can encourage reading. While cleaning, for instance, you might ask your child to read a favorite book to you while you work. Make sure kids get some time to spend quietly with books, even if it means cutting back on other activities, like watching TV or playing video games. Most important, be a reader yourself. Kids who see their parents reading are likely to imitate them and become readers, too!             question:             How does the author advise kids to keep in touch with relatives?             options:             ['A. Make written communication.', 'B. Make a dialogue with each other.', 'C. Learn skills from them.', 'D. Read a catalogue together.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks how the author advises kids to keep in touch with relatives. To answer this, we need to focus on the part of the article that discusses interactions with relatives.
The relevant section states: "Ask relatives to send your child letters, e-mail, or text messages, and read them together. Help your child create letters or messages to send back to the relatives."
From this information, it's clear that the author suggests written communication as a method for kids to keep in touch with relatives. This involves both receiving and sending letters, emails, or text messages.
Let's evaluate the options based on this information:
- A. Make written communication. 
  This option matches the advice given, as it involves letters, emails, and messages.
- B. Make a dialogue with each other.
  This option implies spoken communication which isn't mentioned in the specified context about relatives.
- C. Learn skills from them.
  This is unrelated to the way the author suggests keeping in touch with relatives.
- D. Read a catalogue together.
  This is unrelated to keeping in touch with relatives and does not connect with the communication aspect mentioned in the article.
Therefore, the best answer is:
A. Make written communication.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A

Reading approaches', 'B. Finding reading moments', 'C. Encouraging kids to read', 'D. What reading means to kids']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the text, let's analyze the main themes and ideas presented in the article:
1. The article emphasizes the importance of integrating reading into daily life to help kids develop reading and writing skills.
2. It provides various strategies and examples of how parents and guardians can incorporate reading into everyday activities, such as car trips, waits in lines, cooking, and cleaning.
3. The article stresses the importance of being a role model for reading, showing children that reading is a valuable and enjoyable activity.
Now, let's evaluate each of the given options:
- Option A: "Reading approaches" - This is quite broad and doesn't capture the specific focus on finding moments in daily life to read.
- Option B: "Finding reading moments" - This directly aligns with the central theme of the text, which is about identifying and utilizing opportunities for reading in everyday circumstances.
- Option C: "Encouraging kids to read" - While relevant, it doesn't emphasize the specific idea of finding moments in daily activities as strongly as Option B.
- Option D: "What reading means to kids" - This doesn't accurately reflect the practical focus of the text on incorporating reading into daily life.

Q: article:             After giving a talk at a high school, I was asked to pay a visit to a special student. An illness had kept the boy home, but he had expressed an interest in meeting me. I was told it would mean a great deal to him, so I agreed. During the nine-mile drive to his home, I found out something about Matthew. He had muscular dystrophy  . When he was born, the doctor told his parents that he would not live to five, and then they were told he would not make it to ten. Now he was thirteen. He wanted to meet me because I was a gold-medal power lifter, and I knew about overcoming obstacles and going for my dreams. I spent over an hour talking to Matthew. Never once did he complain or ask, "Why me?" He spoke about winning and succeeding and going for his dreams. Obviously, he knew what he was talking about. He didn't mention that his classmates had made fun of him because he was different. He just talked about his hopes for the future, and how one day he wanted to lift weights with me. When we had finished talking, I went to my briefcase and pulled out the first gold medal I had won and put it around his neck. I told him he was more of a winner and knew more about success and overcoming obstacles than I ever would. He looked at it for a moment, then took it off and handed it back to me. He said, "You are a champion. You earned that medal. Someday when I get to the Olympics and win my own medal, I will show it to you." Last summer I received a letter from Matthew's parents telling me that Matthew had passed away. They wanted me to have a letter he had written to me a few days before:             question:             The boy looked forward to meeting the author because    _   .             options:             ["A. he was one of the author's fans", 'B. he wanted to get to the Olympics and win a medal', 'C. he was also good at weight lifting', 'D. he admired the author for his courage very much']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Matthew, the boy with muscular dystrophy, looked forward to meeting the author, we should analyze the context provided in the article.
1. In the article, it's mentioned that Matthew wanted to meet the author because the author was a gold-medal power lifter who knew about overcoming obstacles and pursuing dreams.
   
2. Matthew, despite his illness, was focused on winning, succeeding, and achieving his dreams. He admired individuals who faced challenges and persevered, which aligns with the author's background.
3. The author interprets Matthew's interest in meeting him as admiration for his perseverance and accomplishments, as shown by the conversation they had and how Matthew talked about achieving his own dreams.
4. Let’s evaluate each of the options:
   - **A.** "He was one of the author's fans": While this might be partially true, the article doesn't emphasize his fan status but rather his admiration for what the author represents.
   
   - **B.** "He wanted to get to the Olympics and win a medal": This is partially correct, as mentioned in the dialogue, but it doesn't directly explain his desire to meet the author specifically.
   
   - **C.** "He was also good at weight lifting": The article does not support this. Matthew

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is correct, let's analyze each one based on the information provided in the passage:
1. **Option A: "Matthew was an athlete"**
   - The passage does not indicate that Matthew was an athlete. It mentions that he had muscular dystrophy, which made physical activities challenging for him. Though he expressed a desire to lift weights, there's no mention of him actually being an athlete.
2. **Option B: "Matthew was an optimistic and determined boy"**
   - The passage provides several pieces of evidence that support this statement. Matthew was not only interested in meeting the author, a gold-medal power lifter, but he also talked about winning, succeeding, and his dreams without complaining about his condition, indicating his optimism and determination.
3. **Option C: "The author used to have the same disease as Matthew had"**
   - There is no indication in the passage that the author had the same disease. The author was a power lifter and spoke about overcoming obstacles, but this does not imply having muscular dystrophy.
4. **Option D: "Matthew became a champion before he died"**
   - The passage does not suggest that Matthew became a champion in a competitive sense. Although he demonstrated a champion spirit in attitude,

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Matthew didn't accept the author's medal, let's consider the context provided in the article:
1. **Matthew's Character**: Throughout the article, it's emphasized that Matthew was a positive and determined individual. He focused on winning, succeeding, and pursuing his dreams, despite his challenges. He did not complain or express self-pity.
2. **Matthew's Reaction to the Medal**: When the author gave Matthew the medal, Matthew looked at it and returned it, stating, "You are a champion. You earned that medal. Someday when I get to the Olympics and win my own medal, I will show it to you."
3. **Implications**: Matthew's refusal of the medal suggests that he didn't want to accept something he didn't earn. His statement about winning his own medal in the Olympics indicates a belief in his own potential and future achievements. He wanted to earn a medal on his own merit.
Given this reasoning, the option that best aligns with Matthew's character and his response is:
- **B. he was sure that he could win one in the future**
This option reflects Matthew's hope and determination to achieve his own success, rather than accepting the medal as a token of pity or charity.

Q: article:             Naps--short sleeps during the day--may improve memory, experts said recently.  New research conducted by brain researcher Avi Karni of the University of Haifa in Israel explores the possibility that naps help lock in sometimes long-term memories. "We still don't know exactly how memory system works during sleep, but the results of this research suggest it is possible to speed up memory consolidation ," Karni said. Long-term memory refers  to memories that stay with us for years, such as "what" memories -- a car accident that happened yesterday-- or "how to" memories, such as one's learned ability to play the pianos. Karni, also one of the authors of the study published in a recent issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience, instructed participants to learn a difficult set of finger games, then divided the study _ into two groups: one that napped for an hour, and one that didn't. The people who took an afternoon snooze showed obvious improvement in their performance by that evening. "After a night's sleep the two groups were at the same level, but the group that slept in the afternoon improved much faster than the group that stayed awake," Karni said. And the study also showed just how much faster a 90-minute nap could help lock in long-term memories. "Daytime sleep can shorten the time 'how to' memory weakens and forgetting starts,"Karni said, "Instead of 6 to 8 hours, the brain consolidated the memory during the 90-minute nap."             question:             We can learn from the article that   _  .             options:             ['A. the new research has discovered the memory process during the sleep', 'B. taking a nap helps improve both long-term and short-term memories', "C.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the article and match it with the options.
1. **Option A: "the new research has discovered the memory process during the sleep"**
   - The article states that researchers do not know exactly how the memory system works during sleep, suggesting that the research did not discover the entire process.
2. **Option B: "taking a nap helps improve both long-term and short-term memories"**
   - The article specifically focuses on long-term memories, such as "what" and "how to" memories. There is no mention of short-term memory improvements.
3. **Option C: "Karni's findings are based on comparisons between two groups of participants"**
   - The article describes how the participants were divided into two groups, with one napping and the other not. This comparison between the two groups forms the basis of the findings, as seen in the described improvements in those who napped.
4. **Option D: "people who take a nap will never forget 'how to' skills once they are learned"**
   - The article does not make such a claim. It highlights that naps can help speed up memory consolidation and suggests a faster improvement in performance but does not guarantee that

Q: article:             Teachers say the digital age has had a good influence - and a not-so-good influence - on this generation of American teenagers.More than 2,000 teachers took an online survey.Three-quarters of the teachers said the Internet and digital search tools have had a "mostly positive" effect on their students' research habits and skills.But 64 percent said the technologies "do more to distract( - - - ---) students than to help them academically." And 87 percent agreed that these technologies are creating an "easily distracted generation with short attention spans." The Pew Internet Project did the survey with the National Writing Project.Judy Buchanan is the vice director of the National Writing Project and a co-author of the report.Ms.Buchanan says digital research tools are helping students learn more and faster."Teachers really favor these tools because they are ways to make some of the learning exciting and engaging.Young people favor these tools.The goal is to really help them become creators of meaningful content, and not just sort of consumers." But one problem the survey found is that many students lack digital literacy.They trust too muck of the information they find on the Internet.Judy says these students haven't developed the skills to determine the quality of online information."It's something that really has to be taught and paid attention to.Because in a world in which things happen quickly, you do need to step back, reflect and analyze the information you have." Another problem is blamed on something that might not seem like a problem at all: being able to quickly find information online.Teachers say the result is a reduction in the desire and ability of their students to work hard to find answers.They say students are overly dependent on search engines and do not make enough use of printed books or research libraries. Many teachers are also concerned that the Internet makes it easy for students to copy work done by others instead of using their own abilities.             question:             The text mainly tells us  _  .             options:             ['A. all the students use digital tools', 'B. the Internet is playing a key role', 'C. teachers encourage using digital tools', 'D. digital tools bring about benefits and problems']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main point of the text, let's break down the key information given:
1. The article discusses how teachers view the impact of the digital age on American teenagers.
2. It highlights both positive and negative influences of digital tools:
   - **Positive Influence**: Over three-quarters of the teachers surveyed see the Internet and digital search tools as having a mostly positive effect on students' research habits and skills. Digital tools help students learn more efficiently and engage with content creatively.
   - **Negative Influence**: 64% of teachers believe these technologies distract students more than they help academically, and 87% agree that they contribute to a generation with short attention spans. Students also struggle with digital literacy, trusting too easily the information they find online without assessing its quality. Furthermore, students tend to rely on quick online searches instead of engaging deeply with research, and there's a concern about copying work rather than developing original content.
3. Given these points, the article is examining both the benefits and challenges that come with the use of digital tools in education. 
Looking at the options:
- Option A ("all the students use digital tools") is mentioned indirectly, but it does not capture the essence of the article.
- Option B ("the Internet is playing a key role")
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. digital tools bring about benefits and problems'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why some students don't tend to work hard, according to the article, let's analyze the details step by step:
1. **Key Problems Identified in the Article**:
   - Students lack digital literacy and trust too much of the information they find on the Internet.
   - The ability to quickly find information online has reduced students' desire and ability to work hard to find answers.
   - Students are overly dependent on search engines and not using printed books or research libraries enough.
   - The ease of finding online information might lead to copying work done by others instead of using their own abilities.
2. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: "they can get answers on the Internet quickly" - This aligns with the point in the article where teachers say the ability to quickly find information online reduces the desire and ability to work hard.
   - **Option B**: "printed books and libraries around aren't enough" - The article discusses students not using printed books and libraries enough, but this isn't directly cited as the reason for not working hard.
   - **Option C**: "the Internet can't make students concentrate" - While lack of concentration is mentioned due to distractions, this isn't directly linked to not working hard.
   - **Option D**:
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is Option A: "they can get answers on the Internet quickly."

Q: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details:
1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time.
2. **Daily Activities**:
   - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities.
   - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week.
   - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning.
   - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time.
Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be "A. sleep in bed," as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A. Sleep in bed

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option best captures the inference from the report, let's analyze the context and the details provided:
1. The earthquake caused significant damage with 50 people dead and 11,000 injured, which highlights the severity and the suddenness of the event.
2. The report notes that scientists did not foresee the earthquake earlier due to clouds preventing proper satellite observation of the temperature at the correct altitude. This suggests that lack of early warning was a contributing factor to the extent of the damage.
3. Besides, the mention of other earthquakes in the last decade highlights that China is subjected to frequent seismic activity. Early warning could potentially mitigate the number of casualties and extent of damage by allowing people to seek safety.
4. Given these points, let's look at the options:
   - Option A ("all the people stayed outside"): While staying outside might reduce injuries during the earthquake, it's not feasible as a preventive measure and does not align with the context of early warnings.
   - Option B ("the earthquake happened at midnight"): Earthquakes can pose dangers regardless of the time, and the report does not specify the time as a factor influencing the extent of the damage.
   - Option C ("the people had been warned earlier"): This closely aligns with the report suggesting that lack of forecasting due

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option can be considered reasonable, except one, let's analyze each choice:
A. "We cannot stop earthquakes" - This is a reasonable statement because earthquakes are natural phenomena that cannot be controlled or stopped by human intervention.
B. "Scientists are working hard at the researches on earthquakes" - This is also reasonable. Scientists are indeed conducting extensive research to better understand earthquakes, predict them, and mitigate their effects.
C. "We can do our best to have fewer damages than ever" - This is a reasonable statement. While humans cannot stop earthquakes, they can implement measures to minimize damages, such as constructing earthquake-resistant buildings, having better emergency response plans, and educating the public on safety measures.
D. "Nothing can be done on earthquakes" - This statement suggests complete inaction or resignation, which is not reasonable. While we cannot prevent earthquakes, there are many actions that can be taken to mitigate damage and enhance preparedness.
Therefore, the option that is not reasonable, given the context of current scientific efforts and established practices in earthquake preparedness and mitigation, is:
D. "Nothing can be done on earthquakes"

Q: article:             In the kitchen of my mother's houses there has always been a wooden stand   with a small notepad   and a hole for a pencil. I'm looking for paper on which to note down the name of a book I am recommending to my mother. Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, the current paper and pencil look the same as they always did. Surely it can't be the same pencil? The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is definitely  the original one. "I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years." I say to her, walking back into the living-room with a sheet of paper and the pencil. "You still use a pencil. Can't you afford a pen?" My mother replies a little sharply. "It works perfectly  well. I've  always kept the stand in the kitchen. I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days." Immediately I can picture her, hair wild, blue housecoat covered in flour, a wooden spoon in one hand, the pencil in the other, her mouth moving silently. My mother smiles and says, "One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a brilliant thought, but the stand was empty. One of the children must have taken the paper. So I just picked up the breadboard and wrote it all down on the back. It turned out to be a real breakthrough for solving the mathematical problem I was working on." This story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how extraordinary my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician. I feel embarrassed that I complain about not having enough child-free time to work. Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards. Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics. Those symbols have travelled unaffected through fifty years, rooted in the soil of a cheap wooden breadboard, invisible   exhibits at every meal.             question:             Why has the author's mother always kept the notepad and pencil in the kitchen?             options:             ['A. To leave messages.', 'B. To list her everyday tasks.', 'C. To note down maths problems.', 'D. To write down a flash of inspiration.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage provides details about the author's mother and the use of the notepad and pencil in the kitchen. The mother has kept the notepad and pencil in the kitchen because she never knew when she might want to note down an idea. The author also describes a moment when the mother was cooking and had a brilliant thought for a mathematical problem, but there was no paper available, so she used a breadboard to jot down her idea. This indicates that the mother used the notepad and pencil to capture moments of inspiration, particularly related to her work as a mathematician.
Now, let's analyze the options:
- A. To leave messages: This option is not supported by the passage. There is no indication that the notepad and pencil were primarily used for leaving messages.
- B. To list her everyday tasks: The passage doesn't mention the mother using the notepad for everyday tasks.
- C. To note down maths problems: While she did write down a mathematical breakthrough once, the primary purpose mentioned is not specifically for math problems.
- D. To write down a flash of inspiration: This is directly mentioned when the mother talks about having a brilliant thought while cooking and needing to capture that moment.
Thus, the correct answer is:
D. To write down a flash of inspiration
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

A: Let's think step by step.
The author expresses amazement that the wooden stand for holding the pad and pencil is still present after all these years. This suggests that the author views the stand as a longstanding and significant fixture in their mother's kitchen. There's no indication that the author believes it needs to be replaced, that it brings back memories of a lonely childhood, or that it should be passed on to the next generation. The focus is more on its continued presence and its connection to the mother's history and routines. It's a symbol of continuity and the mother's dedication to her work as a mathematician. Therefore, the author's original opinion about the wooden stand aligns most closely with option A, "It has great value for the family."

I've  always kept the stand in the kitchen. I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days." Immediately I can picture her, hair wild, blue housecoat covered in flour, a wooden spoon in one hand, the pencil in the other, her mouth moving silently. My mother smiles and says, "One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a brilliant thought, but the stand was empty. One of the children must have taken the paper. So I just picked up the breadboard and wrote it all down on the back. It turned out to be a real breakthrough for solving the mathematical problem I was working on." This story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how extraordinary my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician. I feel embarrassed that I complain about not having enough child-free time to work. Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards. Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics. Those symbols have travelled unaffected through fifty years, rooted in the soil of a cheap wooden breadboard, invisible   exhibits at every meal.             question:             In the author's mind, her mother is  _  .             options:             ['A. strange in behaviour', 'B. keen on her research', 'C. fond of collecting old things', 'D. careless about her appearance']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best option, we need to analyze the author's portrayal of her mother based on the details given in the article.
1. **A. strange in behaviour**: The article doesn't give any indication that her mother is considered strange in behavior by the author. The focus isn't on any peculiarities in how her mother acts.
2. **B. keen on her research**: The mother is described as a "gifted mathematician" who once wrote down a significant mathematical breakthrough on the back of a breadboard. This suggests she was very dedicated and passionate about her work, even while managing household tasks and childcare. This aligns well with being keen on her research.
3. **C. fond of collecting old things**: While there is mention of the old wooden stand for the notepad and pencil being retained over the years, the story is more about the functionality and familiarity rather than a fondness for collecting old things.
4. **D. careless about her appearance**: The description of her with "wild hair" and a "blue housecoat covered in flour" points more to being busy in the kitchen while working through mathematical problems, rather than a general carelessness about appearance. The focus is not on her appearance at all.
Given the detailed description of her
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

Alexander grew to be a handsome, brilliant  man. Aristotle, the famous philosopher , came from Greece to teach him---geography, politics, literature, medicine and science. Alexander's father, King Philip II of Macedon, taught him to plan and win battles. The young prince became King when he was 20. He then began the series of marches that continued until he ruled almost all of the then-known world. On his great war horse, Bucephalus, he first took over Greece. He went on to conquer southeastern Europe, Asia Minor, Egypt and India. On his way he crushed  the Persian Empire, and was made King of Egypt and Asia. He and his troops traveled over 11,000 miles(17,700 km). He spread Greek customs and ideas wherever he went. In India his men refused to go further. They were tired and frightened, and wanted to go home. Worn out, Alexander agreed to turn back.

A: Let's think step by step.
In the given article, it is stated that Alexander the Great was a mighty king and conqueror who led his troops through a series of marches. It specifically mentions that Alexander was on his great war horse, Bucephalus, as he began his conquests and mentions the vast areas he conquered (Greece, southeastern Europe, Asia Minor, Egypt, India, and the Persian Empire).
Given the historical context and the mode of transportation available during Alexander's time, the options for traveling would most likely involve either horses or walking (on foot). There is no mention of ships or trucks in the article, and during Alexander's era (around 356–323 BC), neither trucks nor the kind of ships suitable for troop transport over land existed. 
The narrative emphasizes Alexander on his war horse, suggesting that horses were a primary means of travel for Alexander and his military campaigns. 
Therefore, the most reasonable assumption is that Alexander and his troops traveled and fought primarily on their horses. 
The correct answer is: C. on their horses.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option based on the information provided in the article:
1. **Option A: He died in his late thirties.**
   - The article states that Alexander the Great died at the early age of 33. Therefore, this option is false since 33 is not considered "late thirties."
2. **Option B: Bucephalus was probably a big ship.**
   - The article tells us that Bucephalus was Alexander's great war horse, not a ship. Therefore, this option is false.
3. **Option C: He conquered all the countries then known in the world.**
   - The article mentions that Alexander began a series of marches that continued until he ruled almost all of the then-known world. The use of the word "almost" implies that he did not conquer all the countries. Therefore, this option is false.
4. **Option D: Alexander was very ready to listen to anybody including his officers and soldiers.**
   - There is a point in the article where Alexander's men refused to go further in India because they were tired and frightened, and wanted to go home. Alexander, worn out, agreed to turn back. This suggests that Alexander was willing to listen to
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. Alexander was very ready to listen to anybody including his officers and soldiers.

How Alexander the Great Became King?', 'B. Great Tragedy', 'C. Good Education Makes a Great Man', 'D. Alexander the Great']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for this passage, let's analyze the content of the text and the relevance of each option.
1. **Content Analysis**: 
   - The passage describes the life and accomplishments of Alexander the Great, focusing on his education, military conquests, and the vast empire he built.
   - It highlights his tutelage under Aristotle, his rise to kingship at a young age, and his extensive conquests.
   - The narrative also covers his military campaigns, spread of Greek culture, and his untimely death.
2. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A: "How Alexander the Great Became King?"**
     - This title is too narrow as it would imply the passage focuses primarily on the circumstances around his ascension to kingship, whereas the passage covers his entire life and achievements.
   - **Option B: "Great Tragedy"**
     - This title is misleading as the passage does not describe a tragedy. While Alexander's early death is mentioned, the passage is more about his life and accomplishments rather than tragic elements.
   - **Option C: "Good Education Makes a Great Man"**
     - This title highlights one aspect of the passage, Alexander's education, but does not encapsulate the full scope
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. Alexander the Great

Q: article:             We've all seen them: perfectly toned famous people on late-night television telling us that we too can develop rock-hard abdominal muscles . It's easy! Just pay $149.99 for the Torso Track or $149.75 for the Ad-Doer and watch those unwanted inches leave your waist. Americans spend tens of millions of dollars on various products to firm up their fat around the waist. And did they work? Not necessarily. Independent studies have concluded that most of these products -- no matter who approved them or how expensive they are -- shape your midsection no better than old-fashioned stomach crunches . Some can even cause injury -- like the $518.99 Body Shaper-Q8SP, which left electrical burns on some researchers at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse. Others, like the popular Ab-Doer, typically burn less energy than a gentle walk, according to a study to be published in September by the American Council on Exercise. The fact is that many Americans don't have the biological makeup to develop an obvious abdominal muscles. They are either unable to get the necessary muscle mass or they can't lose enough fat to make a difference. Even if the underlying muscles are well developed, all it takes to hide it is one-sixteenth of an inch of fat. That's enough to exclude most healthy women as well as plenty of guys who do crunches every day. So what works best? In its new study, the exercise experts researched on the results of the popular Ab-Doer. A lengthy TV advertisement promises that just 10 minutes a day performing such movements as "Body Boogies" and "Good Mornings" will "help form those muscles the fun and easy way without diets." Steven Loy, professor at California State University, Northridge, tested the promise by measuring the electrical activity produced by the abdominal muscles during three Ab-Doer movements. He and his colleagues then compared the results with those produced during traditional exercises. They determined that the muscles were no more active, and in some cases less so, when exercisers were using the Ab-Doer. Taking a broader approach, researchers at San Diego State University compared 13 abdominal exercises for their ability to develop the central abdominal muscles. They concluded, in a report published in May, that the most effective exercises kept turning the body and worked the muscles the entire time. Among the winners: the bicycle movements -- so called because it looks as if you are riding a bike while lying flat on the floor -- and exercises performed on the "Captain's Chair", a product typically found in gyms that helps hold the body in the air while you raise your legs up toward your chest. Researchers suggested that a varied routine of the different exercises could deliver the best results.             question:             Which of the following is the most effective in building abdominal muscles?             options:             ['A. Torso Track.', "B. Captain's Chair.", 'C. Ab-Doer.', 'D. Body Shaper-Q8SP.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is the most effective in building abdominal muscles, let's analyze the information provided in the article step by step:
1. **Torso Track and Ab-Doer**: These are commercial products advertised to develop abdominal muscles. The article suggests that these, like many similar products, do not perform significantly better than traditional crunches. In fact, the Ab-Doer is specifically mentioned as burning less energy than a gentle walk and not activating the muscles more than traditional exercises, according to studies.
2. **Body Shaper-Q8SP**: This product is noted for causing injury (electrical burns) and is not mentioned as being particularly effective.
3. **Traditional Exercises and Research Findings**:
   - The article highlights research comparing 13 abdominal exercises, focusing on their effectiveness at activating central abdominal muscles.
   - It mentions that the most effective exercises are those that engage the muscles continuously while turning the body. The "bicycle movements" and exercises performed on the "Captain's Chair" are specifically highlighted as top exercises for developing abdominal muscles. 
   - The "Captain's Chair" in particular is a piece of equipment commonly found in gyms that allows for leg-raise exercises, effectively targeting the abdominal muscles.
In conclusion, the research cited describes the
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. Captain's Chair.

A: Let's think step by step.
The article discusses the difficulty many Americans face in achieving visible firm abdominal muscles. Let's break down the relevant points:
1. **Biological Makeup**: The article mentions that "many Americans don't have the biological makeup to develop an obvious abdominal muscle." This suggests that genetic factors play a significant role in whether individuals can achieve visible abs.
2. **Muscle Mass and Fat Loss**: It further states that some people can't get the necessary muscle mass or lose enough fat to make a difference. Even with well-developed muscles, a small amount of fat (one-sixteenth of an inch) can hide them.
3. **Factors Excluding Many**: This factor of a small amount of fat hindering visibility of muscles excludes most healthy women and many men, indicating it’s not for a lack of trying but due to natural predispositions.
Given these points, the main reason cited by the author for the difficulty in getting visible abdominal muscles is genetic or biological predisposition rather than effort level, exercise routine variation, or injuries.
4. **Conclusion**: The correct interpretation from this breakdown would be that the ability to develop noticeable abs is largely determined by genetic factors.
Therefore, the most accurate choice reflecting this is:
'A. how big their muscles will be is determined by birth'.

To promote proven exercise techniques and to advise against false advertisements.', 'D. To research and develop in order to create the perfect stomach and exercise machine.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage begins by discussing how many Americans are drawn to television advertisements claiming that certain expensive products can help them achieve toned abdominal muscles. However, it quickly points out that these products often do not work as effectively as traditional exercises like stomach crunches. The passage also mentions that some of these products can cause injuries. It supports these claims by discussing independent studies and findings from researchers, examining products like the Ab-Doer, and comparing them to other exercises.
The passage concludes by suggesting that a combination of tried-and-true exercises, such as bicycle movements and exercises on the "Captain's Chair," might deliver the best results for developing abdominal muscles. The overall message seems to focus on promoting exercise methods that are backed by research and discouraging reliance on expensive, potentially ineffective products advertised on TV.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A suggests a focus on promoting a rich healthy lifestyle based on advanced product research, which doesn't align with the passage's critique of commercial products.
- Option B emphasizes the necessity of diet and exercises, which isn’t the primary focus; the passage mainly critiques exercise products.
- Option C indicates promoting proven exercise techniques and advising against false advertisements. This aligns well with the passage's emphasis on effective exercises and caution against misleading product claims.
- Option D suggests

Q: article:             The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. "It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility," a government official said. The company, Dutch Docklands, is currently building floating developments in the Netherlands and Dubai. There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make "land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land". The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change. Nasheed, who staged the world's first underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight his people's dilemma , has even spoken of buying land elsewhere in the world to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. He has also pledged the Hulhumale to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming "carbon neutral" by 2020. His plan involves ending fossil fuel use and powering all vehicles and buildings from "green" sources.             question:             What's the main idea of the passage?             options:             ['A. The Maldives plans to build floating homes for the rising sea level.', "B. The Maldives's president signed a deal with a Dutch company.", 'C. The Maldives staged the first underwater cabinet meeting.', 'D. The Maldives is considering ways to fight against the global warming.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main idea of the passage, let's examine the key points presented in the text:

Q: article:             The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. "It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility," a government official said. The company, Dutch Docklands, is currently building floating developments in the Netherlands and Dubai. There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make "land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land". The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change. Nasheed, who staged the world's first underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight his people's dilemma , has even spoken of buying land elsewhere in the world to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. He has also pledged the Hulhumale to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming "carbon neutral" by 2020. His plan involves ending fossil fuel use and powering all vehicles and buildings from "green" sources.             question:             Which statement is true about the Hulhumale?             options:             ['A. The Hulhumale is a natural island near the capital of Male.', 'B. The Hulhumale is an artificial island to be built near the capital.', 'C. The Hulhumale was built in 1997 and has settled over 30,000 people.', 'D. The Hulhumale is protected by a 30-million-dollar sea wall.']
A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to extract relevant information about the Hulhumale from the given article:
1. The article states that the Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the capital island of Male in 1997.
2. More than 30,000 people have been settled there as of the article's information.
Now, let's evaluate the options one by one:
- Option A: "The Hulhumale is a natural island near the capital of Male." 
  - Based on the article, this statement is false. The Hulhumale is an artificial island.
- Option B: "The Hulhumale is an artificial island to be built near the capital."
  - This is partially correct, but misleading. While the article mentions it as an artificial island, it notes that work on the island began in 1997. Therefore, it has already been built.
- Option C: "The Hulhumale was built in 1997 and has settled over 30,000 people."
  - This statement is true. The article confirms that work began on the Hulhumale in 1997 and that it has settled more than 30,000 people.
- Option D: "The Hulhumale is protected by a 30
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is Option C: "The Hulhumale was built in 1997 and has settled over 30,000 people."

To build more artificial islands for people to settle there.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which of the options is not an idea of President Mohamed Nasheed, let's analyze each one in the context of the article:
A. To purchase land elsewhere in the world to help Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded.
- The article does mention that Nasheed has spoken of buying land elsewhere to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded.
B. To make his nation a model for the rest of the world by becoming "carbon neutral" by 2020.
- The article states that Nasheed has pledged to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming "carbon neutral" by 2020.
C. To stop using fossil fuel and power all vehicles and buildings from "green" sources.
- The article mentions that his plan involves ending fossil fuel use and powering all vehicles and buildings from "green" sources.
D. To build more artificial islands for people to settle there.
- The article talks about an artificial island called Hulhumale, which began development in 1997, to ease the crowded conditions in the capital, but it does not state that building more such artificial islands is Nasheed's current idea or plan.
Therefore, the idea that is NOT attributed to Nasheed in the article is:
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D'.

Q: article:             Prolonging human life has increased the size of the human population. Many people alive today would have died of childhood diseases if they had been born 100 years ago. Because more people live longer, there are more people around at any given time. In fact, it is a decrease in death rates, not an increase in birthrates, that has led to the population explosion. Prolonging human life has also increased the dependency load. In all societies, people who are disabled or too young or too old to work are dependent on the rest of society to provide for them. In hunting and gathering cultures, old people who could not keep up might be left behind to die. In times of  , infants might be allowed to die because they could not survive if their parents starved, where as if the parents survived they could have another child. In most contemporary societies, people feel a moral   to keep people alive whether they can work or not. We have a great many people today who live past the age at which they want to work or are able to work; we also have rules which require people to retire at a certain age. Unless these people were able to save money for their retirement, somebody else must support them. In the United States many retired people live on social security checks which are so little that they must live in near poverty. Older people have more illnesses than young or middle-aged people; unless they have wealth or private or government insurance, they must often "go on welfare" if they have a serious illness. When older people become   or too weak and ill to care for themselves, they create grave problems for their families.

A: Let's think step by step.
The article discusses how the increase in the human population size is more attributed to a decrease in death rates rather than an increase in birthrates. It explains that many people who are alive today would have died from childhood diseases if they were born 100 years ago, but because more people are living longer, there is a larger population at any given time. The article explicitly states that it is the "decrease in death rates, not an increase in birthrates," leading to the population explosion. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option C: a decrease in death rates.

A: Let's think step by step.
The passage discusses how different societies handle the issue of dependency, especially when it comes to those who cannot work such as the aged and infants. In the context of hunting and gathering cultures, the passage mentions that "old people who could not keep up might be left behind to die" and "in times of [scarcity], infants might be allowed to die because they could not survive if their parents starved, whereas if the parents survived they could have another child." This indicates that in such cultures, there was a pragmatic approach to survival where the survival of the group depended more heavily on the able-bodied individuals who could provide for themselves and others.
Let's analyze the options given:
- Option A states it was a moral responsibility to keep the aged alive, but the passage suggests the opposite for hunting and gathering cultures, where survival took precedence.
- Option B suggests the survival of infants was less important than that of their parents during starvation, which aligns with the passage.
- Option C is incomplete and does not provide relevant information.
- Option D suggests death was a time of rejoicing, which is not mentioned in the passage at all.
Therefore, the correct inference from the passage is Option B: the survival of infants was less important than that of their parents in times of starvation.

Many nursing homes are sponsored by religious and nonprofit groups.', 'D. Older people have wealth or private insurance if they have a serious illness.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true about old people in the United States according to the passage, we need to examine the specific points made in the passage about them:
1. The passage states that "In the United States, many retired people live on social security checks which are so little that they must live in near poverty." This aligns with option A, which says, "Many of them live on social security money which is hardly enough." So option A seems accurate.
2. The passage talks about older people living in near poverty because their social security checks are small, suggesting that this is a common situation. This contradicts option B, which claims that only a minority remain in near poverty.
3. The passage mentions, "These are often profit-making organizations, although some are sponsored by religious and other nonprofit groups," about nursing homes and hospitals. It doesn't specify that many are sponsored by nonprofit groups, which makes option C not entirely accurate without further context suggesting that the number is significant.
4. The passage notes that unless older people have wealth or insurance, they might have to rely on welfare. This suggests that not all older people have wealth or insurance, contradicting option D, which implies they usually do.
Therefore, the most accurate statement reflecting the passage is option A: "
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A. Many of them live on social security money which is hardly enough.

Q: article:             When Regina Mary' parents refused to let her get a horse ,the smart 15-year-olddidn't sit in her room and complain. Instead she turned to a cow called Luna to make her riding dreams come true.

The pairs unlikely friendship started about two years ago, shortly after Luna was born on the Mayer's farm. They started off with walks in the woods. Then Mayer slowly got her cow more adapted to human contact and riding equipment. About six months later, it was time to see how Luna would respond to a rider on her back in a competition for horses.

To determine the main topic of the passage, let's analyze the provided information and the given options:
1. **Summary of the Passage:**
   - Regina Mary wanted a horse but turned to a cow named Luna instead.
   - Regina trained Luna for riding and jumping.
   - Their bond is strong, and they spend a lot of time together.
   - The process involved adapting Luna to human contact and riding equipment.
   - Luna participated in a horse competition with Regina riding her.
2. **Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A: "a cow performing in a horse competition"**
     - While Luna did participate in a horse competition, the main focus of the passage isn't about the competition itself but rather the training and relationship between Regina and Luna.
   - **Option B: "a German girl training a cow successfully"**
     - This option aligns closely with the passage content, as it highlights Regina (a German girl) training Luna (the cow) for riding, which is a central theme.
   - **Option C: "the way of gaining friendship from a cow"**
     - While friendship between Regina and Luna is mentioned, the core subject is about training rather than the process of developing friendship.

Q: article:             Teary Joe was a boy with a special ability: he could make himself cry in less than a second. If he disliked something, or things became difficult, Teary Joe would not hesitate to put on a pitiful face and set great big tears running down his cheeks. In this way he managed to get practically everything he wanted, because no one could resist the pity inspired by his tearful little face. But one day, Teary Joe met Pipo.  Pipo was asking people in the street for some change, in return for him helping them in any way he could. Pipo was very poor; he had no home and no family, so he made a living however he could. Even so, Pipo always had the biggest smiles on his face. Joe took to Pipo, so he decided to help him out in making some money. He went over next to Pipo, took off his hat, put it face-up on the ground, and started crying with the most pitiful of expressions. Ina few minutes, Joe's hat was full of coins and sweets, but when Joe offered all this to Pipo, Pipo declined. "I prefer deserving what I receive," answered Pipo with his usual smile, "It's much more fun making an effort to get things. Maybe I haven't gotten everything I've wanted, but I've done a load of interesting things." Teary Joe didn't answer; he just walked sadly away. Joe had got everything he wanted, but he'd done practically nothing of interest the whole day. That evening, having returned home, Joe requested a delicious cake for his supper. When his mother said no, Joe tried to cry but, remembering Pipo and how joyful he was, he tried to get the cake in some other way. Joe spent the whole evening helping his mother to water the plants and organize the library books. In the end there was no cake. But that wasn't so bad, because Joe discovered it had been much more fun doing all those things that evening rather than just sitting crying to get a piece of cake that, in the end, wouldn't have been worth it.             question:             According to the passage, Teary Joe   _  .             options:             ["A. relied on others' sympathy   before", 'B. was joyful in his life', 'C. hated working hard', 'D. was a naughty boy']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most accurate option, let's evaluate each statement based on the passage:
A. "relied on others' sympathy before"
- The passage states that Teary Joe had a special ability to make himself cry, and he used this ability to get practically everything he wanted because no one could resist the pity inspired by his tears. This directly aligns with the idea that he relied on others' sympathy.
B. "was joyful in his life"
- The passage doesn't specifically mention that Teary Joe was joyful in his life. In fact, the focus is more on his method of getting what he wanted rather than his overall happiness or joy.
C. "hated working hard"
- The passage indicates that Joe typically didn't make an effort to achieve things until he met Pipo, who showed him the value of working for what he wanted. However, it doesn't explicitly state that Joe hated working hard.
D. "was a naughty boy"
- While Joe used his crying ability to get what he wanted, the passage doesn't explicitly describe him as being naughty. The term "naughty" implies mischievous or disobedient behavior, which isn't specifically addressed in the text.
Based on the analysis, the option that best fits the evidence from the passage is:
A. relied

A: Let's think step by step.
In the story, Teary Joe meets Pipo, who, despite being poor and without a family, is happy and finds enjoyment in working for what he receives. Pipo's philosophy is that making an effort to earn things is more rewarding. When Joe sees how Pipo operates and refuses to take the "easy" gains that Joe's crying provides, it strikes a chord with Joe. Joe leaves Pipo feeling sad because he faces the realization that he, Joe, has been getting things without working for them, which contrasts with Pipo's fulfilling life full of effort and interest.
Let's evaluate the options given:
- A. considered that Pipo was very poor: This is true, but it is not the reason for Joe's sadness. Joe's sadness stems from his reflection on his life in comparison to Pipo's.
- B. realized he shouldn't change his life style: The story does not suggest this because Joe actually tries to change his lifestyle later by helping his mom.
- C. didn't get delicious cake for supper: This happened later in the story, not at the moment Joe walked away from Pipo.
- D. got everything he wanted without delight: This option aligns well with Joe's realization that, although he has always gotten what he wanted, Pipo
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. got everything he wanted without delight

Q: article:             Teary Joe was a boy with a special ability: he could make himself cry in less than a second. If he disliked something, or things became difficult, Teary Joe would not hesitate to put on a pitiful face and set great big tears running down his cheeks. In this way he managed to get practically everything he wanted, because no one could resist the pity inspired by his tearful little face. But one day, Teary Joe met Pipo.  Pipo was asking people in the street for some change, in return for him helping them in any way he could. Pipo was very poor; he had no home and no family, so he made a living however he could. Even so, Pipo always had the biggest smiles on his face. Joe took to Pipo, so he decided to help him out in making some money. He went over next to Pipo, took off his hat, put it face-up on the ground, and started crying with the most pitiful of expressions. Ina few minutes, Joe's hat was full of coins and sweets, but when Joe offered all this to Pipo, Pipo declined. "I prefer deserving what I receive," answered Pipo with his usual smile, "It's much more fun making an effort to get things. Maybe I haven't gotten everything I've wanted, but I've done a load of interesting things." Teary Joe didn't answer; he just walked sadly away. Joe had got everything he wanted, but he'd done practically nothing of interest the whole day. That evening, having returned home, Joe requested a delicious cake for his supper. When his mother said no, Joe tried to cry but, remembering Pipo and how joyful he was, he tried to get the cake in some other way. Joe spent the whole evening helping his mother to water the plants and organize the library books. In the end there was no cake. But that wasn't so bad, because Joe discovered it had been much more fun doing all those things that evening rather than just sitting crying to get a piece of cake that, in the end, wouldn't have been worth it.             question:             Joe's attitude towards Pipo's getting things by making efforts was   _  .             options:             ['A. ridiculous', 'B. faulty', 'C. doubtful', 'D. agreeable']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine Joe's attitude towards Pipo's approach to getting things through effort, let's consider the events of the story:
1. **Introduction of Characters**:
   - Teary Joe has always used his ability to cry to get what he wants without making any effort.
   - Pipo, on the other hand, despite being poor, smiles and believes in earning what he receives through effort.
2. **Interaction Between Joe and Pipo**:
   - Joe, witnessing Pipo's positivity, tries to help him by using his crying tactic to earn money.
   - When Joe offers the earnings to Pipo, Pipo refuses, expressing his preference for earning things through effort.
3. **Joe's Reaction and Reflection**:
   - Joe is initially silent after Pipo's explanation, indicating a moment of contemplation rather than outright rejection or misunderstanding.
   - Joe then goes home and, when denied cake, remembers Pipo's words and chooses to experience making an effort by helping around the house instead of crying.
4. **Conclusion**:
   - By the end of the evening, despite not getting the cake, Joe finds enjoyment in the activities he participated in, indicating a change in his mindset influenced by Pipo's perspective.
   - Joe's decision to try making
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. agreeable'

He doesn't have home and is poor.", 'B. He still prefers crying to getting things.', 'C. He built up true friendship with Pipo.', 'D. He was greatly influenced by Pipo.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To infer something about Teary Joe, we need to evaluate his actions and thoughts throughout the story.
1. Teary Joe initially uses his ability to cry to get whatever he wants, without any effort, indicating he’s used to manipulating situations in his favor.
2. When he meets Pipo, who is very poor but finds joy and pride in earning what he receives, Joe is introduced to a new perspective on life.
3. Joe tries to help Pipo by using his crying to get money and sweets, but Pipo refuses, sharing his philosophy that effort and earning things is more satisfying.
4. After the interaction with Pipo, Joe reflects on his day and how uninteresting it was, despite getting what he wanted through tears.
5. That evening, instead of crying for a cake, Joe decides to help his mother with chores, finding that the experience was more rewarding than just crying for a cake.
Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Teary Joe was influenced by his encounter with Pipo. Instead of using tears for immediate gratification, he learns the value of effort and finds joy in working for things, even if he doesn’t get exactly what he wants (like the cake). Thus, Teary Joe experiences a significant change in outlook due to P
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. He was greatly influenced by Pipo.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question accurately, we need to focus on what Janice Min specifically said about Taylor Swift in the article. 
1. **Option A** mentions that "Taylor Swift is a seven-time Grammy winner and the best-selling digital music artist of all time." While this information is present in the article, it is not attributed to Janice Min but rather is a general fact about Taylor Swift.
2. **Option B** states "Taylor Swift appeared in the performed in the Radio 1 Live Lounge." This detail is in the article but it's not a statement from Janice Min.
3. **Option C** says "Taylor Swift is worthwhile to be given the award a second time." The article quotes Janice Min as saying, "We are tremendously excited to be honouring her as the 2014 Billboard Woman of the Year for the second time," which aligns with this statement. Janice Min emphasizes her excitement about honoring Taylor Swift for a second time.
4. **Option D** indicates that "Taylor Swift would be performing on The X Factor results show this weekend." Although this is mentioned in the article, Janice Min didn't discuss this information.

Q: article:             We all know what a brain is.  A doctor will tell you that the brain is the organ of the body in the head. It controls our body's functions, movements, emotions and thoughts. But a brain can mean so much more. A brain can also simply be a smart person,  If a person is called brainy, she is smart and intelligent.  If a family has many children but one of them is super smart, you could say, "She's the brains in the family. " And if you are the brains behind something you are responsible for developing or organizing something.  For example, Bill Gates is the brains behind Microsoft. Brain trust is a group of experts who give advice.  Word experts say the phrase"brain trust" became popular when Franklin D. Roosevelt first ran for president in 1932,  Several professors gave him advice on social and political issues facing the U. S.These professors were called his "brain trust. " These ways we use the word "brain" all make sense. But other ways we use the word are not so easy to understand. For example, to understand the next brain expression, you first need to know the word"drain." As a verb to drain means to remove something by letting it flow away. So a brain drain may sound like a disease where the brain flows out the ears.  But, brain drain is when a country's most educated people leave their countries to live in another. The brains are,sort of,draining out of the country. However,if people are responsible for a great idea,you could say they brainstormed it. Here,brainstorm is not an act of weather.  It is a process of thinking creatively about a complex topic. For example,  business leaders may use brainstorming to create new products, and government leaders may brainstorm to solve problems. If people are brainwashed, it does not mean their brains are nice and clean.  To brainwash means to make someone accept new beliefs by using repeated pressure in a forceful or tricky way. Keep in mind that brainwash is never used in a positive way.             question:             According to the text, if you're the CEO of  Bai Du you can be called  _  .             options:             ['A. the brains behind Bai Du', "B. Bai Du's brain trust", 'C. the brain drain of Bai Du', 'D. the organ of Bai Du']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify which phrase fits the role of a CEO according to the explanations in the text.
- **"The brains behind Bai Du"**: The text explains that being "the brains behind something" means you are responsible for developing or organizing it. A CEO, who is responsible for leading and making strategic decisions for a company, would fit this description.
- **"Bai Du's brain trust"**: The text describes a "brain trust" as a group of experts who give advice. This does not fit the role of a CEO, who is an individual leader rather than a group.
- **"The brain drain of Bai Du"**: The text explains that "brain drain" refers to educated people leaving a country. This would not apply to a CEO, as it is not related to leadership or organizational responsibility.
- **"The organ of Bai Du"**: This phrase does not logically describe a CEO, as "organ" is used in a different context related to the human body.
Therefore, the correct answer is **A. the brains behind Bai Du**.

Because he was smart at giving advice.', 'B. Because word experts were popular.', 'C. Because he got his brain trust.', 'D. Because he was the brains behind America.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to determine which option best explains Roosevelt's success in winning the election, based on information provided in the article.
1. **Examine the options:**
   - **A. Because he was smart at giving advice.**
     - The article doesn't mention anything about Roosevelt giving advice. Instead, it focuses on receiving advice from his "brain trust".
   
   - **B. Because word experts were popular.**
     - The article mentions word experts only in the context of how phrases with "brain" are used, not in relation to Roosevelt's campaign or election.
   
   - **C. Because he got his brain trust.**
     - The article clearly mentions that Roosevelt had several professors who gave him advice on social and political issues, and these professors were referred to as his "brain trust". This implies that their advice could have contributed to his success.
   
   - **D. Because he was the brains behind America.**
     - This doesn't relate to the content of the article, and the phrase "brains behind America" isn't used in the text.
2. **Identify the right choice:**
   The article highlights that Roosevelt's "brain trust" was a group of experts advising him, which likely supported his success in the

Brain trust', 'B. Brain drain', 'C. Brainstorm', 'D. Brainwash']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which expression is always used in a negative way, let's review each option based on the definitions provided in the article:
- **A. Brain trust**: This refers to a group of experts who give advice. It originated when Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for president in 1932, and several professors gave him advice on social and political issues. This term doesn't have a negative connotation; instead, it suggests expertise and collaboration.
- **B. Brain drain**: This expression describes a situation where a country's most educated people leave their country to live elsewhere. While the term can imply a negative impact on the country losing talent, it doesn't inherently mean something negative. It describes a situation rather than something intrinsically bad.
- **C. Brainstorm**: This refers to the process of thinking creatively about a complex topic. It is a positive and constructive activity used to generate ideas and find solutions.
- **D. Brainwash**: This means making someone accept new beliefs by using repeated pressure in a forceful or tricky way. The article explicitly states that brainwash is never used in a positive way, implying manipulation and coercion.
From this analysis, the expression that is always used in a negative way is:
**D. Brainwash**

PS7', 'B. PS17', 'C. PS27', 'D. PS20']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the cost of watching the new play with your parents, let's look at the details provided in the article:
1. The play is "Through the Looking Glass" at Houghton Mill, scheduled for Monday, 30th August.
2. Ticket prices are as follows:
   - Adult: PS10
   - Child: PS7
   - Family: PS20
Since you are going with your parents (assuming two adults and one child), you can either buy individual tickets or a family ticket. 
- Individual tickets would cost: 2 adults x PS10 + 1 child x PS7 = PS20 + PS7 = PS27.
- A family ticket costs PS20.
The most cost-effective option for you is to buy a family ticket, which is PS20.
Therefore, the total cost for you and your parents to watch the play together is PS20.
The correct answer is: D. PS20.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D

Playing farmland games.', 'B. Watching the new play.', 'C. Competing in sports activities.', 'D. Visiting the dinosaur exhibition']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which activity needs parents' company, let's examine each option with regard to the requirement stated in the article:
A. Playing farmland games: The description of the Farmland Games at the Farmland Museum and Denny Abbey states that it is suitable for children aged four and above, and specifies that "each child should be accompanied by an adult." This indicates that playing farmland games requires parents' company.
B. Watching the new play: The event at Houghton Mill involves a new production called "Through the Looking Glass." There is no mention of a requirement for children to be accompanied by their parents or an adult, so this option does not seem to require parents' company.
C. Competing in sports activities: The Saxon Youth Club offers various activities, including sports competitions for young people aged 13-19. There is no indication that this age group must be accompanied by parents, so this option does not require parents' company.
D. Visiting the dinosaur exhibition: The article mentions the dinosaur exhibition at Peterborough Museum, but there is no mention of a necessity for parental accompaniment.
In conclusion, only option A, "Playing farmland games," explicitly states that a child should be accompanied by an adult. Thus, the activity that needs parents' company is:
A.

Q: article:             BEIJING -- After a night of wining and dining with 50 of China's richest people, Warren Buffet and Bill Gates told the journalists on Thursday that the biggest difference between eating with Chinese tycoons  and Western ones was the food. "I was amazed last night, really, at how similar the questions and discussions and all that were to those in the dinners we had in the U.S.," said Mr. Buffett. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates, two of the best known Westerners here, announced in September, 2010 that they planned to invite 50 wealthy Chinese tycoons to dinner in Beijing to encourage philanthropy  among China's new rich. On Thursday, the two men pronounced the dinner a great success, saying that two-thirds of those invited had shown up, and that more than half of them had offered their own ideas on how Chinese philanthropy should work. The guest list wasn't made public, but the Chinese news media reported that it included Jet Li, the movie star; Niu Gensheng, the founder of a Chinese dairy business; and Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin, who control the SOHO China real estate  empire. As with four earlier dinners held in the United States, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates said, no one at the Beijing event was asked to donate money or to promise to engage in charity. "Bill and I won't be calling anybody. What happens in China will depend on what the Chinese people feel about a project of this sort," said Mr. Buffett. China is widely reported to be second only to the United States in the number of dollar billionaires. Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett said the nation was unique because its wealthy class had arisen almost wholly in the past 30 years, so the philanthropic practices established among European and American dynasties are new here, and open to change. The two said the dinner wasn't a long planned matter, but  _ of a trip that Mr. Buffett had already scheduled to Guangdong and Hunan Provinces, where BYD Company, a maker of clean-energy automobiles, has factories. Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, holds a 10% stake  in the company. But Mr. Gates suggested that their philanthropic trip wasn't yet over. "We may do an event in India," he said.             question:             What is the text mainly about?             options:             ['A. A brief analysis of future philanthropy.', 'B. The development of Chinese philanthropy.', "C. An introduction on Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates' trip in China.", 'D. A charity dinner held in Beijing by Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The text is mainly about an event involving Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in Beijing, where they dined with 50 wealthy Chinese individuals to encourage philanthropy among China's newly wealthy class. The central focus is on the dinner itself, including the outcomes and context in which it was held, as well as the participation of notable individuals. It highlights the similarities in discussions between this event and those held previously in the U.S., and emphasizes that the dinner was a part of a larger philanthropic initiative rather than a standalone event. The text also mentions future plans that Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett have regarding philanthropic activities, possibly in other countries like India.
Now let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: "A brief analysis of future philanthropy." While future philanthropy is alluded to, the central focus is on the specific dinner held in Beijing, not on a future planning analysis.
  
- Option B: "The development of Chinese philanthropy." While the text discusses philanthropy in China, it specifically revolves around the dinner event, rather than providing a broader overview of the development of philanthropy in the country.
- Option C: "An introduction on Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates' trip in China." Though there is mention of their visit to BYD Company in Guangdong and H
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. A charity dinner held in Beijing by Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates.'

Beijing will be the last stop of their philanthropic trip', 'D. the Chinese news media published the complete guest list of the dinner']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option against the information provided in the article:
A. "China has the largest number of dollar billionaires in Asia."
- The article states, "China is widely reported to be second only to the United States in the number of dollar billionaires." This implies that China likely has the largest number of billionaires in Asia, but the article does not explicitly confirm this within Asia by itself, so this option needs more validation.
B. "Many people have promised to donate money at dinner."
- The article clearly mentions, "As with four earlier dinners held in the United States, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates said, no one at the Beijing event was asked to donate money or to promise to engage in charity." Thus, this option is incorrect.
C. "Beijing will be the last stop of their philanthropic trip."
- The article states that "Mr. Gates suggested that their philanthropic trip wasn't yet over," and he mentions the possibility of doing an event in India. Therefore, Beijing is not necessarily the last stop, making this option incorrect.
D. "The Chinese news media published the complete guest list of the dinner."
- The article says, "The guest list wasn't made public, but the Chinese news media reported that

Q: article:             Drama and the performing arts are excellent methods of building confidence in children and adults alike. Learning through drama allows children to explore their creativity and have fun while leaving their shyness and worries behind. Drama also works by supporting the growth of imagination and other skills. Entertainmet has become rather passive with cinema, television, and computer games becoming more popular. These screen-based methods have had a negative effect on communication. However, drama puts the " _ " back into entertainment. Children have the opportunity to connect with others in a more meaningful way as drama encourages speech development and awareness of body language, and allows the child to become more socially aware. Play and drama are closely linked. When children play a game, they are pretending and using their imagination and so are moving away from reality to create their own story. Drama is a vehicle through which children can express themselves more freely through mime , gesture, movement, and speech to make education fun. Children gain confidence by understanding that there is no final answer in drama and that their opinion and contribution are valued. Children are able to give a personal response to many issues and situations such as poverty, bullying , global warming and recycling. The issues that drama can deal with are endless. Drama and education have a strong link as drama can encourage children to take an active interest in other subjects such as geography, history, and English and so have a more rounded education. As a drama teacher, I have witnessed children at their first class holding onto their parent's arm-unwilling to let go. Then to see the same child later running ino my class with smile is an excellent sight. Drama installs confidence in children by allowing them to improvise  and experiment. Everyone is given the opportunity to shine within drama.             question:             Performing drama is likely to help children  _  .             options:             ['A. invent something useful', 'B. imagine anything they like', 'C. become more confident in themselves', 'D. develop an interest in doing experiments']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the main points presented in the article regarding what drama provides for children.
1. The article states that drama and the performing arts "are excellent methods of building confidence in children and adults alike." This phrase directly indicates that drama helps in building confidence.
2. Another part highlights that drama allows children to explore their creativity, express themselves more freely, and encourages them to engage in activities such as mime, gesture, movement, and speech.
3. It also mentions that drama helps children to improvise and experiment, suggesting trial and error and creative freedom but doesn't directly relate this to inventing something useful or developing an interest in scientific experiments.
4. The text continuously emphasizes that drama helps children to leave their shyness behind, become socially aware, and interact with others meaningfully.
Therefore, out of the given options, the most consistent with the article’s focus is "C. become more confident in themselves," as the beneficial aspects of drama regarding self-confidence are explicitly highlighted multiple times in the passage.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

Q: article:             "English may be the global language of business but it is not enough by itself for companies to gain a lasting presence in many markets," the European Commission   says in a study published last month. The study collected by the British National Centre for Languages for the EU leader, says over 10 per cent of 2,000 small and medium-sized   firms in 29 European countries sampled   in the study have lost export contract   because of lack of language skills. The study says French is used to trade with partners in Africa, Spanish in Latin America, and Russian in Eastern Europe. "The picture is far more complex than the much-quoted view that English is the world language," the study says. Multilingual   Commissioner Leonard Orban admitted that English plays an important role worldwide, but he wants to improve more linguistic variety within the EU. The EU's linguistic headaches have exploded with the group's expansion. Languages have become a sensitive topic in Brussels where English is increasingly eclipsing   French as the main working language of the organization. Translation of EU papers into EU's 23 official languages costs 1 billion euros (US $1.31 billion) a year. "We want to be open not only to official languages of the Union, but also to others like regional   languages, languages of minorities, immigrants'   languages and third countries' languages," Orband said. Many EU students have improved their language skills during non-formal learning activities. Young people from more than 20 different nationalities travel across Europe to participate together in many cultural programmes, language courses, thematic workshops   and other activities that are organized in about 100 cities.             question:             When did the European Commission say that English is not enough by itself for trade?             options:             ['A. Last week.', 'B. Last month.', 'C. On Dec. 20, 2006.', 'D. On Apr. 1, 2007.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question of when the European Commission stated that English is not enough by itself for trade, let's refer to the article. The article mentions: "the European Commission says in a study published last month."
This implies that the statement by the European Commission regarding English not being sufficient was made in the context of a study published last month, relative to the current time in which the article was written. Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. Last month.

1. **French** - Mentioned as a language used for trade with partners in Africa.
2. **Spanish** - Mentioned as a language used for trade in Latin America.
3. **Russian** - Mentioned as a language used for trade in Eastern Europe.

A: Let's think step by step.
We need to determine what the article says about the role of English in Brussels. Let's break down the details:
1. **Context from the Article**: The article discusses the role of English as a global business language, noting that while it is important, it is not sufficient alone for business success in many markets within the EU. It mentions the increasing importance of multilingualism.
2. **Brussels Context**: Specifically regarding Brussels, the article mentions that "Languages have become a sensitive topic in Brussels where English is increasingly eclipsing French as the main working language of the organization."
3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: "Many people are studying English." - The article doesn’t specifically mention anything about people studying English.
   - **Option B**: "English is not studied by university students." - This is not supported by the article; it doesn't discuss university students or their study habits.
   - **Option C**: "Most of people are interested in Russian." - This is not mentioned in the article regarding Brussels.
   - **Option D**: "English is increasingly eclipsing French." - This matches the article's statement about language use in Brussels, specifically regarding the dominance of English over French in the organization.
Therefore, option
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. English is increasingly eclipsing French.

Don't Ignore That Study", 'B. Pay much Attention to English', 'C. Do Study Many Languages besides English', 'D. The Other Language Is More Important than English']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage discusses the importance of multilingualism for businesses, the predominance of English as a global business language, and the European Commission's views on language diversity within the EU. It highlights the limitations of relying solely on English for international trade and commerce, pointing out the value of other languages like French, Spanish, and Russian in specific regions. The multilingual nature of the EU and the costs associated with translation into multiple languages are also mentioned. 
Let's evaluate the options for the best title:
A. "Don't Ignore That Study" - This option is vague and doesn't capture the essence of the passage, which is more about language diversity and not solely on a particular study.
B. "Pay Much Attention to English" - This option suggests a focus on English, contrasting with the passage's emphasis on the inadequacy of relying solely on English for international trade.
C. "Do Study Many Languages besides English" - This option aligns well with the passage's message that while English is important, businesses and the EU benefit from having multilingual capabilities to effectively engage in international markets and within the Union.
D. "The Other Language Is More Important than English" - This option is misleading as it suggests that other languages are more important than English, rather than equally important alongside English for certain contexts.

Q: article:             Australia's worst pests are the rabbits, introduced by a settler who released 24 into the wild for sport hunting. In less than 100 years, the rabbits grow into the millions of ones, leaving large areas of land looking like the surface of the moon due to thousands of rabbit caves. The spread   of the rabbits in Australia was the fastest of all animals in the world. The spread of the rabbits' disease in 1950 cut the number, but it was not until 1997 when the spread of another disease targeted   the pests that the number was finally brought under control. Farm losses due to rabbits today still remain a surprising total A $200 million (US$112 million) a year.       The European red foxes, also released for sport hunting, are growing and eating sheep flocks, costing farmers A$40 million (US $22.4 million) a year. The State of Victoria offers a A$10 (US$5.6) prize for each fox tail and has gathered 25,000 in a few months.      Foxes are one of the biggest threats to wildlife in Australia. Foxes kill thousands of lambs , birds and native wildlife. Australia lost its long battle against wild pests.             question:             Which of the following is Not mentioned?             options:             ['A. A great many rabbits eat too much trees.', 'B. Rabbits make too much caves.', 'C. The surface is destroyed a lot by rabbits.', 'D. The birth rate of the rabbits is high.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which of the options is not mentioned in the given article, let's evaluate each statement based on the information provided:
A. A great many rabbits eat too much trees.  
- The article does not specifically mention rabbits eating trees. It discusses the destruction caused by rabbits, such as leaving large areas of land looking like the surface of the moon due to rabbit caves, but tree-eating is not explicitly mentioned.
B. Rabbits make too much caves.  
- The article mentions that rabbits have left large areas of land looking like the surface of the moon due to thousands of rabbit caves, which indicates that they make many caves.
C. The surface is destroyed a lot by rabbits.  
- The article states that large areas of land look like the surface of the moon due to rabbit activity, indicating surface destruction by rabbits.
D. The birth rate of the rabbits is high.  
- The article does not explicitly mention the birth rate of rabbits, although it implies a rapid population increase by stating that the rabbit population grew into millions in less than 100 years.
Based on the above evaluation, option A, "A great many rabbits eat too much trees," is not mentioned in the article. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A

Q: article:             Australia's worst pests are the rabbits, introduced by a settler who released 24 into the wild for sport hunting. In less than 100 years, the rabbits grow into the millions of ones, leaving large areas of land looking like the surface of the moon due to thousands of rabbit caves. The spread   of the rabbits in Australia was the fastest of all animals in the world. The spread of the rabbits' disease in 1950 cut the number, but it was not until 1997 when the spread of another disease targeted   the pests that the number was finally brought under control. Farm losses due to rabbits today still remain a surprising total A $200 million (US$112 million) a year.       The European red foxes, also released for sport hunting, are growing and eating sheep flocks, costing farmers A$40 million (US $22.4 million) a year. The State of Victoria offers a A$10 (US$5.6) prize for each fox tail and has gathered 25,000 in a few months.      Foxes are one of the biggest threats to wildlife in Australia. Foxes kill thousands of lambs , birds and native wildlife. Australia lost its long battle against wild pests.             question:             What reduced the number of the rabbits?             options:             ['A. Hunting', 'B. Poisoning', 'C. Disease', 'D. Flood.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what reduced the number of rabbits in Australia, we can examine the information provided in the article:
1. The introduction of rabbits into the wild and their proliferation into millions is described, causing significant damage to the environment and agriculture.
2. The article mentions that the spread of a disease in 1950 significantly reduced the number of rabbits.
3. It further notes that another disease was responsible for finally bringing the rabbit population under control in 1997.
Based on this information, the primary factor that reduced the number of rabbits was disease.
Therefore, the correct option is:
C. Disease

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer to the question "Australia once fought against _" based on the article, we should identify which animals are discussed as pests causing significant problems for Australia. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Identify the Pests**: 
   - The article mentions rabbits as pests introduced for sport hunting that later multiplied rapidly, causing significant damage to the land and agricultural losses.
   - The European red foxes are also mentioned as pests, growing in number and preying on sheep flocks, leading to further economic losses for farmers.
2. **Impact of the Pests**: 
   - The rabbits have caused extensive agricultural damage resulting in high financial losses. Multiple measures, including the introduction of diseases, were used to control their population.
   - The red foxes are causing additional economic losses and are considered a major threat to native wildlife, prompting local authorities to offer a bounty for their control.
3. **Options Analysis**: 
   - Option A: "sheep and rabbits" - Sheep are not pests, they are farmed animals affected by pests.
   - Option B: "rabbits and red foxes" - Both rabbits and red foxes are mentioned as pests in the article, indicating this as a possible correct option.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

A: Let's think step by step.
The passage discusses the impact of modern technology on children and their connection to nature. The concern is that children are spending more time with technology and less time outdoors, leading to a disconnect with nature. The author suggests that without experiencing nature, children miss out on important benefits to their physical health, mental health, stress levels, creativity, and cognitive skills. The passage also mentions that the lack of outdoor play is linked to poorer health outcomes for children compared to their parents.
Now let's examine the options:
- A. Keep a high sense of wonder: The passage suggests that nature experience fosters a sense of wonder, not the opposite. Therefore, without experiencing nature, children may lose this sense of wonder.
- B. Be over-protected by their parents: Although the passage mentions that children are over-protected, this is not presented as a direct consequence of not experiencing nature.
- C. Be less healthy both physically and mentally: The passage clearly states that children without a nature experience are missing out on a huge enrichment of their lives, affecting their physical and mental health. Experts predict poorer health outcomes for modern kids partly due to a lack of outside play.
- D. Change wild places and creatures for the better: The passage implies the contrary; children disconnected from nature might not grow up

A: Let's think step by step.
The context of the passage suggests that the author is expressing concern about the lack of outdoor play and natural experiences in children's lives, which are critical for their overall development and wellbeing. 
The author mentions that repetitive stress from computers is "replacing breaking an arm as a childhood rite of passage." This implies that "breaking an arm" is perceived as a typical, perhaps even positive, natural aspect of childhood play and exploration, even though it can be a negative experience. The phrase suggests that, historically, a child breaking an arm while playing outdoors is a normal part of childhood that comes with exploring and engaging with the world around them. It contrasts with the modern idea of stress from excessive computer use, which is portrayed more negatively.
Therefore, the answer that aligns with this understanding is:
B. the natural experience in their growing up.

A: Let's think step by step.
The passage discusses the author's concerns about children spending too much time with technology and not enough time in nature, which could lead to negative consequences for both the environment and the children's development. The author expresses worry about a "disconnect" between kids and the outdoors and highlights the importance of nature experiences for children's physical and mental health, creativity, and development of leadership skills.
Now, let's evaluate each option:
A. Blame children for getting lost in computer games: The passage does not place blame on children for their engagement with technology. Instead, it recognizes that children are over-protected and frightened by adults, with technology being a part of modern life. It suggests it's more of an issue with adult responsibility rather than faulting the children themselves.
B. Encourage children to protect parks from encroachment: While the passage mentions the need for future generations to protect natural spaces, the primary focus is on the lack of nature experiences negatively impacting children's development. The mention of defending parks is more about the consequences of losing these experiences rather than a direct call to action for children themselves.
C. Show his concern about children's lack of experience in nature: This is the main focus of the passage. The author is primarily concerned about how the absence of interaction with nature affects children in various aspects and emphasizes the

The passage provides a detailed description of the activities that occur during the opening ceremonies of the Sahara Festival. It talks about the procession of people, the display of traditional culture through music and dance, and various races involving camels and horses. 
- The passage begins by mentioning the opening ceremonies and describes the sequence of events that follow. 
- Tourists and locals participate in the festivities which include marching, dancing, and animal races.
- There is a particular emphasis on the grand finale of the opening day, which is an exciting horse race with riders performing spectacular feats.
  
Given the content and focus of the passage, it is primarily concerned with the events of the opening day of the Sahara Festival. It doesn't go into detail about the activities of the entire three-day event, the closing ceremonies, or solely how animals race. Thus, the most suitable option would be:

Q: article:             "Whatever",totally tops most annoying word in the poll .So, you know, it is what it is, but Americans are totally annoyed by the use of "whatever,,in conversations. The popular term of indifference was found most annoying in conversations by 47 percent of the Americans surveyed in a Marist College poll on Wednesday. "Whatever" easily beat out "you know," which especially annoyed a quarter of interviewers. The other annoying expressions were "anyway"(at 7 percent), "it is what it is',(11percent) and "at the end of the day"(2 percent). "Whatever" is an expression with staying power. It left everyone a deep impression in the song by Nirvana ("oh well, whatever, never mind")in 1991 and was popularized by the Valley Girls in the film "Clueless",later that decade. It is still commonly used, often by younger people. It can be a common argument-ender or a signal of indifference. And it can really be annoying. The poll found '"whatever" to be consistently disliked by Americans regardless of their race, sex, age, income or where they live. "It doesn't surprise me because 'whatever,is in a special class, probably,,,said Michael Adams, author of "Slang ~The People's Poetry" and an associate professor of English at Indiana University. "It's a word that  and it depends on how a speaker uses it  can suggest being not worthy of attention or respect.',Adams, who didn't take part in the poll and is not annoyed by "whatever," points out that its use is not always negative. "It can also be used in place of other neutral phrases that have fallen out of favor, like 'six of one, half dozen of the other,." he said. However, he also noted that the negative meaning of the word might explain why "whatever,was judged more annoying than the ever-popular "you know".             question:             Which tops second among the annoying expression according to the passage?'             options:             ['A. Whatever.', 'B. You know.', 'C. Anyway.', 'D. It is what it is.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which phrase ranks second among annoying expressions according to the passage, let's break down the key details:
1. The passage reports on a Marist College poll that was conducted to find the most annoying words or phrases in conversations among Americans.
2. "Whatever" topped the list, as found to be the most annoying by 47% of those surveyed.
3. The passage states that "whatever" easily beat out "you know," which annoyed a quarter of the interviewers. This indicates that "you know" is second, as 25% considered it annoying.
4. The other expressions mentioned are "anyway" at 7%, "it is what it is" at 11%, and "at the end of the day" at 2%, all of which have lower percentages compared to "you know."
From this analysis, we can conclude that "you know" ranks second among the most annoying expressions according to the passage. Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. You know.

It became popular because of Nirvana.', 'B. It can be commonly used at the beginning of an agreement.', "C. Old people like it while young people don't.", 'D. Almost half of the Americans surveyed disliked it.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information given in the article.
1. The article states that the word "whatever" was found to be the most annoying in conversations by 47 percent of Americans surveyed. This information is directly related to option D, which says that "Almost half of the Americans surveyed disliked it."
2. Option A mentions Nirvana, indicating that "whatever" became popular because of them. The article does mention Nirvana in connection with the phrase, but it credits the Valley Girls from "Clueless" for popularizing it in the 90s, rather than implying Nirvana made it popular.
3. Option B suggests that "whatever" can be used at the beginning of an agreement. However, the article discusses its use as a term of indifference or an argument-ender, not specifically as the beginning of an agreement.
4. Option C claims that old people like it while young people don't. The article actually states that "whatever" is commonly used by younger people, indicating a generally negative reaction across various demographics, not a preference among older individuals.
Given this analysis, the most accurate answer is:
D. Almost half of the Americans surveyed disliked it.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

Q: article:             "Whatever",totally tops most annoying word in the poll .So, you know, it is what it is, but Americans are totally annoyed by the use of "whatever,,in conversations. The popular term of indifference was found most annoying in conversations by 47 percent of the Americans surveyed in a Marist College poll on Wednesday. "Whatever" easily beat out "you know," which especially annoyed a quarter of interviewers. The other annoying expressions were "anyway"(at 7 percent), "it is what it is',(11percent) and "at the end of the day"(2 percent). "Whatever" is an expression with staying power. It left everyone a deep impression in the song by Nirvana ("oh well, whatever, never mind")in 1991 and was popularized by the Valley Girls in the film "Clueless",later that decade. It is still commonly used, often by younger people. It can be a common argument-ender or a signal of indifference. And it can really be annoying. The poll found '"whatever" to be consistently disliked by Americans regardless of their race, sex, age, income or where they live. "It doesn't surprise me because 'whatever,is in a special class, probably,,,said Michael Adams, author of "Slang ~The People's Poetry" and an associate professor of English at Indiana University. "It's a word that  and it depends on how a speaker uses it  can suggest being not worthy of attention or respect.',Adams, who didn't take part in the poll and is not annoyed by "whatever," points out that its use is not always negative. "It can also be used in place of other neutral phrases that have fallen out of favor, like 'six of one, half dozen of the other,." he said. However, he also noted that the negative meaning of the word might explain why "whatever,was judged more annoying than the ever-popular "you know".             question:             In Adams' opinion, the reason why "whatever",was judged more annoying may be that   .   _             options:             ["A. most of the people don't like it", 'B. it can be used in place of other neutral phrases', 'C. it carries certain negative meaning sometimes', "D. the poor don't like it"]
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the given question, let's analyze the provided information from the article and focus on Adams' opinion regarding why "whatever" is considered more annoying.
1. The article mentions that "whatever" was found to be the most annoying word, cited by 47 percent of Americans surveyed. This suggests a widespread dislike.
2. Michael Adams, an expert quoted in the article, provides some insights:
   - He mentions that "whatever" can suggest being not worthy of attention or respect, indicating a potential negative connotation.
   - Adams also notes that its use is not always negative and that "whatever" can replace neutral phrases like "six of one, half dozen of the other."
   - He specifically notes that the negative meaning of "whatever" might explain why it is judged more annoying than "you know."
Considering these points, option C, "it carries certain negative meaning sometimes," aligns with Adams' opinion as it directly addresses his insight about the negative connotations being a reason for the annoyance associated with the word. 
Therefore, the correct answer to the question based on Adams' opinion is:
C. it carries certain negative meaning sometimes
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true, let's analyze each option based on the passage:
A. Adams is not only a writer but also a professor.
- The passage states, "Michael Adams, author of 'Slang ~The People's Poetry' and an associate professor of English at Indiana University." This confirms that Adams is indeed both a writer and a professor. So, this statement is true.
B. "Whatever" is a signal of concern.
- The passage suggests that "whatever" is an expression of indifference: "It can be a common argument-ender or a signal of indifference." Therefore, this statement is false.
C. Adams is angry at the word "whatever."
- The passage explicitly states, "Adams, who didn't take part in the poll and is not annoyed by 'whatever,'" which indicates that Adams is not angry at the word. This statement is false.
D. "Whatever" will be replaced by "You know."
- The passage does not suggest that "whatever" will be replaced by "you know." It merely states that "whatever" was found to be more annoying than "you know." Thus, this statement is false.
Therefore, the true statement is:
A. Adams is not only a writer but also a professor.

On the Internet there are many powerful computers called "servers" to help people send and receive emails. The sending and receiving servers are just like post offices. If you want to use the email service, you have to open at least an email account  called a "mailbox", just like we set up a mailbox in a post office. Some mailboxes are provided free of charge by ISPs, which you can get when you open an Internet account. Most widely used mailboxes are provided free by the ISPs, and anyone can apply for one even if he has no ISP account. How to apply for a free mailbox?

Then you'll find an icon  showing "apply for a free mailbox", click the icon, an agreement about the rules for using the free mailbox will appear. If you want to go on, click the icon "I agree". Then you have to fill in a form about your basic personal information, and the name and pin of the mailbox. The pin is the key to the mailbox. After finishing these, you'll get a mailbox like this: your name @ mail server, for example: jack@ 163. com. The mailbox is separated into two parts by a separator "@", which is read as "at". The former part is the name of the mailbox. The latter   is the domain name  of the mail server. All mails to you will be received by the server and put into your mailbox. You can read this mail on any computer in the world as long as you have the name and pin of the mailbox.             question:             If you want to send or receive an email, you should first   _  .             options:             ['A. write to the ISPs', 'B. fill in a form', 'C. apply for a mailbox', 'D. go to the post office']

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the name of the mailbox from an email address, we need to look at the part of the email address that comes before the "@" symbol. 
Given the email address "ecpjyb@ecp.com.cn":
1. The email address is divided into two parts by the "@" symbol.
2. The part before the "@" is "ecpjyb", which represents the name of the mailbox.
3. The part after the "@" is "ecp.com.cn", which represents the domain name of the mail server.
Therefore, the name of the mailbox is "ecpjyb".
The answer is: D. ecpjyb.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best option for Johnny, we should analyze the given advice in the article and see which suggestion aligns with making time for activities like reading comic books.
1. **A. Expect to work.** - This advice emphasizes the importance of focusing on schoolwork and recognizing that school requires effort, not leisure activities like reading comic books.
2. **B. Do today's work today.** - This implies that Johnny should complete his school tasks promptly, ensuring that he keeps up with his responsibilities, which could potentially free up time for leisure activities if he stays on top of his work.
3. **C. Plan your time.** - Planning how he allocates his time effectively would allow Johnny to manage both school responsibilities and leisure activities like reading comic books. This involves organizing his schedule to balance his academic duties and personal interests.
4. **D. Don't be too disappointed if things sometimes go badly.** - This encourages resilience but doesn't directly address time management or balancing different activities.
Given the options, **C. Plan your time.** is the most suitable choice. By planning his time effectively, Johnny can ensure he meets his academic obligations and still enjoys reading comic books during his leisure time.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

The question asks which statement is NOT true according to the passage.
1. **Option A**: "If you are not interested in things at school, you are likely to feel bored."
   - The passage mentions the importance of being interested in school life and subjects to prevent boredom. Therefore, this statement aligns with the passage and is true.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best answer to the question, we need to consider the context and the overall message of the article.
1. **Purpose of Raising Your Hand**: The article emphasizes taking an active interest in school life and subjects, being involved, and maintaining a positive attitude. Raising your hand in class can be seen as an indication of active participation and engagement in learning.
2. **Options Consideration**:
   - Option A suggests you will impress your teacher. While participating can indeed impress teachers, the article focuses more on personal growth and gaining the most from school rather than impressing others.
   - Option B suggests that other students will admire you. This is possible, but the article emphasizes self-improvement and personal learning rather than gaining admiration from peers.
   - Option C states that raising your hand means you will enjoy school and learn more. This aligns well with the article’s overall message about being engaged and proactive in learning to have a happier school experience.
   - Option D relates to parental happiness, but the article doesn’t specifically focus on parents’ reactions.

Q: article:             Sometimes the real world can be a confusing place. It is not always fair or kind. And in the real world there are not always happy endings. That is why, every once in a while, we like to escape into the world of fantasy -- a place where things always go our way and there is always a happy ending. We want to believe in fantastic creatures in imaginary lands. We want to believe in magic powers, good friends, and the power of good to overcome evil. We all fantasize about being able to fly and lift buildings off the ground. And how good a magic sword would feel in our hand as we go off to kill a dragon or win the hand of a beautiful princess. The amazing adventures of Superman, Peter Pan, and Harry Potter have charmed many people, children and adults alike. The main reason is that these stories offer us chances to get away from this real, frustrating world and allow us to find some magical solutions to our problems. For example, Superman always arrives in the nick of time to prevent a disaster from happening. Peter Pan can fly at will to tease the bad guy Captain Hook, and Harry Potter has his magic power to take revenge  on his uncle, aunt and cousin, who always ill-treat him.             question:             People enter the world of fantasy for the following reasons EXCEPT that   _  .             options:             ['A. the world of fantasy frightens us', 'B. the real world is often disappointing', 'C. we can find happy endings there', 'D. we can always have our wishes fulfilled']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the reasons given in the article for why people enter the world of fantasy and see which option does not align with those reasons.
1. The article states that the real world can be "a confusing place" that is "not always fair or kind" and lacks "happy endings." This indicates that people might enter the world of fantasy because the real world is often disappointing, which aligns with option B.
2. The article mentions that people like to escape into fantasy where "things always go our way and there is always a happy ending." This implies that people enter fantasy because they can find happy endings there, aligning with option C.

Q: article:             Sometimes the real world can be a confusing place. It is not always fair or kind. And in the real world there are not always happy endings. That is why, every once in a while, we like to escape into the world of fantasy -- a place where things always go our way and there is always a happy ending. We want to believe in fantastic creatures in imaginary lands. We want to believe in magic powers, good friends, and the power of good to overcome evil. We all fantasize about being able to fly and lift buildings off the ground. And how good a magic sword would feel in our hand as we go off to kill a dragon or win the hand of a beautiful princess. The amazing adventures of Superman, Peter Pan, and Harry Potter have charmed many people, children and adults alike. The main reason is that these stories offer us chances to get away from this real, frustrating world and allow us to find some magical solutions to our problems. For example, Superman always arrives in the nick of time to prevent a disaster from happening. Peter Pan can fly at will to tease the bad guy Captain Hook, and Harry Potter has his magic power to take revenge  on his uncle, aunt and cousin, who always ill-treat him.             question:             Superman, Peter Pan, and Harry Potter have charmed many people, because   _  .             options:             ['A. the bad guys always have the upper hand', 'B. they end up getting married to beautiful princesses', 'C. their solutions are anything but magical', "D. they possess powers that ordinary people don't have"]
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Superman, Peter Pan, and Harry Potter have charmed many people, we need to consider the context provided in the article. The article discusses how fantasy provides an escape from the real world, where things might not go our way and there aren’t always happy endings. It highlights the desire for magic, imaginary lands, and fantastic creatures, and the appeal of having powers to overcome problems and defeat evil. 
1. The article specifically mentions the magical escapism offered by these stories, where things like flying, magic powers, and magical solutions to problems are prevalent.
2. It gives examples of these characters using their unique powers for special accomplishments or to deal with challenges effectively.
3. Superman is noted for arriving just in time to prevent disasters, Peter Pan for his ability to fly, and Harry Potter for his magical powers.

Q: article:             For many workers trying to lose weight, the weekend is a chance to do some exercise and eat something healthier than a supermarket sandwich at their desk. But some slimmers take a slightly different approach -- consuming more than half their weekly calorie intake from Friday night to Sunday. Away from the daily routine at work that helps them keep control of what they eat, they are snacking and drinking their way to a shocking 10,000 calories, a survey has found. Almost three-quarters of people trying to lose weight admit to over-eating at the weekend. A meal with friends or family, complete with alcohol, as well as a late-night snack before bed, can lead to adults consuming up to 3,500 calories in one day, a survey found. Men typically need 2,500 calories a day and women 2,000 calories. Consuming this amount would see men and women get through half their weekly calorie intake over the course of a 'bad' weekend. Women were found to eat less on a Sunday because of guilt over their consumption over the previous two days. Men had fewer doubts about a third day of excess. The biggest weekend diet danger comes from snacking between meals, the survey found. Some say they will often spend Saturday night in front of the TV with their families -- combining watching their favorite shows with crisps and biscuits. And seven in ten people admitted to having fattening takeaways at weekends, with pizza the most popular. Alcohol is another big factor in weekend bingeing.Around 70 percent still like to have a roast on a Sunday or a big meal with family or friends and a third of those will have second helpings. A spokesman from Forza Supplements, the diet company that conducted the survey, said, "We all have bad weekends where we have a lot of fun, but dieting goes out of the window." The 5:2 diet is becoming increasingly popular -- where we limit our calories for five days and allow ourselves a few treats on the other two days. "For many people, the two days off are Saturday and Sunday but they go way too far"             question:             Which kind of weekend diet does the greatest harm?             options:             ['A. Having a big meal with family and friends.', 'B. Drinking a lot.', 'C. Having fattening takeaways', 'D. Snacking between the meals.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which kind of weekend diet does the greatest harm, we need to evaluate the impact of each option based on the information provided in the article.
1. **A. Having a big meal with family and friends.**
   - The article mentions that around 70 percent still like to have a roast on a Sunday or a big meal with family or friends. A third of those will have second helpings. While this can contribute to excess calorie intake, it does not specifically highlight it as the greatest harm.
2. **B. Drinking a lot.**
   - Alcohol is mentioned as another big factor in weekend bingeing. It contributes significantly to calorie intake, but again, the article does not emphasize it as the greatest source of harm compared to other options.
3. **C. Having fattening takeaways.**
   - Fattening takeaways, with pizza being the most popular, are mentioned in the context of creating a significant caloric intake, but the article does not single it out as the greatest harm.
4. **D. Snacking between the meals.**
   - The article states that the biggest weekend diet danger comes from snacking between meals. This suggests that snacking contributes the most to the excessive calorie intake experienced during weekends.

Q: article:             Scientists have been puzzled by the phenomenon that migrating birds fly not just in groups all the time, but in "V" formations and they have tried to figure out what benefit birds get from this particular formation. Now, a research group from University of London may have found the answer -- migrating birds fly in a "V" to save energy, according to a study published in the journal Nature. When a bird flaps  its wings, it stirs the air around it and causes it to move indifferent directions. Scientist found in the study that the air creates an upward-moving wave at the tips of the wings, which means that if a bird flies around the wingtips of another bird, it can get a boost  from the rising air and therefore use less energy to stay in the air. Apart form the "free ride" strategy, scientists were also surprised to observe that migrating birds timed their wing beats and adjusted their positions in a very precise way to maximize the lifting effect while avoiding areas where the air move downward. "They're able to sense what's going on from the bird in front, where this 'good air' is coming from and now how to position themselves perfectly in it," lead researcher Steven Portugal told BBC. In fact, the "V" formation has long thought to help birds fly more efficiently . A previous study showed that birds' heart rates went down when they were flying together in a "V" formation. Jet fighters were also found to be able reduce their energy use by up to 18% by staying near the wingtips of other jet fighters. Both of these findings led scientists to suspect that the "V" formation had an efficiency purpose, but until now they still lack proof. "For scientists, the new study provides an insight into an interesting natural phenomenon. But it could mean even more for aircraft companies -- helping them understand how they can _ that with their plane formations to save fuel, said Portugal."             question:             What is the author's purpose in writing this article?             options:             ['A. To explain how birds benefit from migration.', 'B. To introduce how migrating birds find their way.', 'C. To tell some applications of migrating birds\' "V" formations.', 'D. To report new findings about migrating birds\' "V" formations.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The article primarily focuses on explaining the new scientific findings regarding why migrating birds fly in a "V" formation. It discusses the benefits that birds derive from this formation, mainly focusing on energy savings by taking advantage of the upward-moving air created by the bird flying in front. The article mentions how birds time their wing beats and position themselves to maximize these benefits. 
Furthermore, the article references past studies and draws parallels with jet fighters to emphasize the significance of the "V" formation in terms of energy efficiency. However, the main emphasis is on presenting the new research findings related to birds' "V" formations.
The discussion of aircraft companies and potential applications serves to connect the scientific findings to broader implications but is not the central focus of the article. 
Therefore, considering the options provided:
- Option A: The article is not about how birds benefit from migration in general, but specifically about the "V" formation.
- Option B: The article doesn't discuss how birds find their way during migration.
- Option C: While there is a mention of potential applications, the primary purpose is not to discuss these applications.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information given in the article:
1. **Key Observation**: The study by the University of London found that migrating birds fly in a "V" formation primarily to save energy.
2. **Mechanism**: When a bird flaps its wings, it creates an upward-moving wave at the wingtips. Birds flying in the "V" formation position themselves around the wingtips of the bird in front to gain energy from the rising air (a "free ride"), allowing them to use less energy.
3. **Additional Observations**: 
   - Birds time their wing beats and adjust their positions precisely to maximize the lifting effect while avoiding downdrafts.
   - The "V" formation is thought to improve flight efficiency, as earlier studies observed lower heart rates in birds flying in this formation.
Now let's evaluate each option:
- **Option A: they don't change their lead birds during the whole journey**: The article doesn't provide specific information about changing or not changing lead birds.
- **Option B: they fly in "V" formations to protect themselves against enemies**: Protecting against enemies is not mentioned as a reason for the "V" formation.

It has led scientists to discover that birds\' heart rates go down when they fly in a "V".', 'D. It shows that the best formation of jet fighters in battle should be a "V" formation.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the significance of the new study according to the article, we should examine the findings and implications mentioned:
1. **Understanding the Phenomenon**: The study reveals that migrating birds fly in a "V" formation primarily to save energy. This is achieved by taking advantage of the upward-moving wave created by the bird in front, which allows them to use less energy.
2. **Scientific Insight**: The study provides insights into the natural phenomenon of how birds work collectively to maximize efficiency in flight, as evidenced by their precise timing and positioning.
3. **Implications for Aircraft Companies**: The article suggests that the study's findings could have potential applications for aircraft companies, particularly in improving the efficiency of plane formations. This is highlighted by Portugal's remark about the possible inspiration for aircraft companies to save fuel.
Examining the answer options in light of the above points:
- **Option A**: "It might inspire aircraft companies to think of ways to improve efficiency." This aligns with the implication for aircraft companies to utilize similar strategies to save fuel.
- **Option B**: "It has proved that the 'V' formation can improve efficiency in many fields." This is less specific to the article's content since the primary focus is on birds and, potentially, aircraft
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A. It might inspire aircraft companies to think of ways to improve efficiency.

Q: article:             Be sure to book a table if the restaurant you choose is an expensive or a popular one. You will feel embarrassed to show up without booking and having to wait for a table, leaving very bad impression on your friend, especially your girl friend. Also, be sure to check to see if you need to be properly dressed and tell your friend ahead of time what to wear.    When your food arrives, proper dining manners make you eat at a right pace so that you have time to talk. A good measure of how fast you should eat is to count 10 seconds between each mouthful and it's bad manners if you eat too fast and then spend the rest of the time watching your friend eat.    Don't make noise when having soup and chewing, or chew with your mouth open.    Your napkin should be placed on your lap at all times. Don't put it in any other place. If you have to get up, place it neatly on your seat.    When eating, put your fork straight in your mouth. Don't place your fork in the side of your mouth as it increases the chances of dropping your food, which could be very embarrassing. If you get food stuck in your mouth, don't pick it out with your fingers or fork at the table. Excuse yourself and go to the restroom and get it out with a toothpick.    When dining, keep your eyes on your friend at all times and try to smile between mouthfuls. Sometimes, you should make an effort to show some interest and ask questions like, "How do you like the beef?" If she needs, you are the one who is supposed to flag down the waiter by a gentle wave of the hand until someone notices you.             question:             If you want to eat in a popular restaurant, the author of the passage suggests that   _  .             options:             ['A. you book a table beforehand', 'B. you book a table beforehand and check to be properly dressed', 'C. you go with a friend', 'D. you just show up any time you want']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to determine what the author suggests you do if you want to eat at a popular restaurant.
1. The passage advises that if the restaurant is popular or expensive, you should book a table in advance: _"Be sure to book a table if the restaurant you choose is an expensive or a popular one."_
2. The passage also mentions checking if you need to be properly dressed: _"Also, be sure to check to see if you need to be properly dressed and tell your friend ahead of time what to wear."_

You will feel embarrassed to show up without booking and having to wait for a table, leaving very bad impression on your friend, especially your girl friend. Also, be sure to check to see if you need to be properly dressed and tell your friend ahead of time what to wear.    When your food arrives, proper dining manners make you eat at a right pace so that you have time to talk. A good measure of how fast you should eat is to count 10 seconds between each mouthful and it's bad manners if you eat too fast and then spend the rest of the time watching your friend eat.    Don't make noise when having soup and chewing, or chew with your mouth open.    Your napkin should be placed on your lap at all times. Don't put it in any other place. If you have to get up, place it neatly on your seat.    When eating, put your fork straight in your mouth. Don't place your fork in the side of your mouth as it increases the chances of dropping your food, which could be very embarrassing. If you get food stuck in your mouth, don't pick it out with your fingers or fork at the table. Excuse yourself and go to the restroom and get it out with a toothpick.    When dining, keep your eyes on your friend at all times and try to smile between mouthfuls. Sometimes, you should make an effort to show some interest and ask questions like, "How do you like the beef?"

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct inference from the passage, let's analyze each option:
**A. the writer of the passage favors those dining manners**: 
The passage provides detailed instructions on dining etiquette, indicating approval of those manners. The writer seems to be promoting these dining practices, suggesting they are favorable.
**B. the writer of the passage is not a Chinese**: 
The passage does not provide any specific information about the writer's nationality. Making an inference based solely on dining manners is not reliable, as dining etiquette can vary widely within cultures and many people from different cultures adopt or promote similar dining practices.
**C. toothpick is available in the restroom**: 
The passage suggests that if you get food stuck in your mouth, you should excuse yourself to the restroom to use a toothpick. However, it does not explicitly state that toothpicks are available in the restroom, only that it is the appropriate place to use one.
**D. toothpick is not to be found on a dinner table**: 
The text indicates that you should not use a toothpick at the table if food is stuck in your teeth, implying that toothpicks are not to be used or perhaps not found on the dinner table. This aligns with the suggestion to go to the restroom
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

Q: article:             One of the most difficult questions to answer is how much a job is worth. We naturally expect that a doctor's salary will be higher than a bus conductor's wages. But the question becomes much more difficult to answer when we compare a miner with an engineer, or an unskilled man working on an oil-rig with a teacher in a secondary school. What the doctor, the engineer and the teacher have in common is that they have devoted several years to studying in order to obtain the necessary qualifications for their professions. We feel instinctively that these skills and these years should be rewarded. At the same time we recognize that the work of the miner and the oil-rig laborer is both hard and dangerous, and that they must be highly paid for the risks they take. Another aspect we must take into consideration is how socially useful a man's work is. Most people would agree that looking after the sick or teaching children is more important than, say, selling second-hand cars. Yet it is almost certain that the used-car salesman earns more than the nurse and the schoolteacher. Indeed, this whole question of just rewards can be turned on its head. You can argue that a man who does a job which brings him personal satisfaction is already receiving part of his reward in the form of a so-called "psychic wage", and that it is the man with the boring, repetitive job who needs more money to make up for the soul-destroying repetitiveness of his work. It is significant that the jobs like nursing and teaching continue to be poorly paid, while others, such as those in the world of sport or entertainment, carry financial rewards out of all proportion to their social worth. Although the amount of money that people earn is largely determined by market forces, this should not prevent us from seeking some way to decide what is the right pay for the job. A starting point would be to try to decide the ratio which ought to exist between the highest and the lowest paid. The picture is made more complicated by two factors: firstly by the welfare benefits which every citizen receives, and secondly by the taxation system which is often used as an instrument of social justice by taxing high incomes at a very high rate indeed. Most countries now regard a ratio of 7:1 as socially acceptable. If it is less, the highly-qualified people carrying heavy responsibilities will become disappointed, and might even end up by leaving for another country. If it is more, the difference between rich and poor will be so great that it will lead to social unrest.             question:             Why do people naturally expect that doctors should be well-paid?             options:             ['A. Their work requires greater intelligence.', 'B. They are under constant pressure at work.', 'C. They work harder than most other people.', 'D. They have studied for years to get qualified.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand why people naturally expect that doctors should be well-paid, we can break down the various factors that contribute to this expectation:
1. **Role and Responsibility**: Doctors play a crucial role in society by diagnosing and treating illnesses, and they hold significant responsibilities regarding patients' health and well-being. This naturally suggests that their work is highly valued and should be compensated accordingly.
2. **Level of Education and Qualification**: The original article points out that the doctor has devoted several years to studying in order to obtain the necessary qualifications for their profession. This significant investment in education and training is a key reason why people expect doctors to be well-paid. It implies that their skills and qualifications warrant a higher salary.
3. **Skills and Expertise**: Doctors require specialized skills and in-depth medical knowledge, which they gain through rigorous education and training. This expertise further supports the notion that they should be well-compensated.
Among the options provided, option D, "They have studied for years to get qualified," directly aligns with the justification provided in the article for why doctors are expected to be well-paid. It points to the years of education and training required to become a doctor, thereby underlining a key reason for expecting higher compensation.
It is important to note that each of the
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. They have studied for years to get qualified.

Those receiving high salary should carry heavy responsibilities.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement the author would agree with, we need to analyze the key points of the article:
1. The article explores the complexity of determining the worth of a job, considering factors like education, risk, social usefulness, and personal satisfaction (psychic wage).
2. It highlights the disparity in pay between jobs with different levels of social value and personal satisfaction, such as nursing and teaching versus jobs in sports and entertainment.
3. The author discusses how market forces play a significant role in determining pay but suggests that this should not stop us from seeking a way to establish fair compensation.
4. A specific suggestion made by the author is to establish an appropriate ratio between the highest and lowest paid, mentioning that a 7:1 ratio is deemed socially acceptable by many countries.
With these key points in mind, let's evaluate the provided options:
- **A. It's difficult to define the social value of a job.**  
  This option aligns with the author's discussion on how complex it is to assess the social value of jobs, as the article delves into the comparison and different aspects of job worth.
- **B. The market will decide what the right pay is for a job.**  
  While the article acknowledges that market forces largely determine pay, the author argues

Lincoln, even though great, was not proud.', 'B. Lincoln was a great and proud man.', 'C. Lincoln lacked self-respect.', 'D. Lincoln had a good sense of humor.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the right statement, let's analyze the story and the options provided.
The story illustrates that Abraham Lincoln enjoyed telling a humorous story about himself wherein a stranger believed that Lincoln was the ugliest person he had ever seen, even more so than himself. The fact that Lincoln consistently told this story with delight indicates that he was comfortable laughing at himself and did not take himself too seriously.
Now, let's examine the options:
- **A. Lincoln, even though great, was not proud.**
  - This statement aligns with the story. Lincoln was a distinguished figure, yet he could laugh at himself, indicating humility and lack of pride.
- **B. Lincoln was a great and proud man.**
  - This statement contradicts the essence of the story. The narrative suggests that he was not overly proud since he openly shared a funny story that poked fun at his appearance.
- **C. Lincoln lacked self-respect.**
  - This statement is not supported by the story. Laughing at oneself does not equate to lacking self-respect; it often shows confidence and self-awareness.
- **D. Lincoln had a good sense of humor.**
  - This statement is also correct according to the story, as Lincoln found humor in the situation and shared it with

Q: article:             There once was a little boy who wanted to meet the king. He set off, walking towards the king's castle. After many years of walking, the king's castle came into his view. However, as the boy drew closer to the outside of the castle, the guards noticed him. "Get out of here!" ordered the guards. Well, _ . He turned...and ran. All he wanted to do was to tell the king wonderful things, and see all the beautiful things in the king's house. But he couldn't even get near the castle! The boy finally stopped running, sat down and cried. A young man happened to be coming down the path at the very moment. He saw the little boy and stopped. "What's wrong, young man?" he asked. "Sir, I walked and walked just to see the king. But these guards made me scared. I wanted to tell the king how lovely everything is and just tell the king that I just wanted to see him.!" The man looked at the little boy thoughtfully. "Look, why don't you try again. I'll come with you this time." The little boy got up and took the man's hand. The king's guards spotted them. "Look, mister, we don't have to do this...I don't want you to get hurt. We can just turn around now." The man held the little boy's hand and went on. The boy really thought the man might be crazy until he looked back up at the guards. They were all smiling now. The little boy was amazed. "Who are you?" asked the little boy in astonishment. "Why, I'm the king's son. You can enter the castle and be with the king." Said the man. The little boy broke into a huge smile.             question:             Why did the boy want to see the king?             options:             ['A. To get some help from the king.', 'B. To invite the king to visit his beautiful village.', 'C. To share wonderful things with the king.', 'D. To ask the king to play with him.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the boy wanted to see the king, we should analyze the information provided in the article. 
1. The article starts with the little boy setting off on a journey to meet the king.
2. It mentions that the boy wanted to tell the king wonderful things and see the beautiful things in the king’s house.
3. Specifically, when the boy explains to the young man why he is upset, he says, "I wanted to tell the king how lovely everything is and just tell the king that I just wanted to see him."
Now, let's consider the options given in the question:
- Option A: To get some help from the king. There is no mention in the article about the boy needing help from the king.
- Option B: To invite the king to visit his beautiful village. This option isn't supported by the article's details.
- Option C: To share wonderful things with the king. This aligns directly with the boy's desire as expressed in the article to tell the king wonderful things.
- Option D: To ask the king to play with him. The article does not indicate that the boy wanted to ask the king to play with him.
Based on this analysis, the best choice is Option C: To share wonderful things with the king.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C

Q: article:             There once was a little boy who wanted to meet the king. He set off, walking towards the king's castle. After many years of walking, the king's castle came into his view. However, as the boy drew closer to the outside of the castle, the guards noticed him. "Get out of here!" ordered the guards. Well, _ . He turned...and ran. All he wanted to do was to tell the king wonderful things, and see all the beautiful things in the king's house. But he couldn't even get near the castle! The boy finally stopped running, sat down and cried. A young man happened to be coming down the path at the very moment. He saw the little boy and stopped. "What's wrong, young man?" he asked. "Sir, I walked and walked just to see the king. But these guards made me scared. I wanted to tell the king how lovely everything is and just tell the king that I just wanted to see him.!" The man looked at the little boy thoughtfully. "Look, why don't you try again. I'll come with you this time." The little boy got up and took the man's hand. The king's guards spotted them. "Look, mister, we don't have to do this...I don't want you to get hurt. We can just turn around now." The man held the little boy's hand and went on. The boy really thought the man might be crazy until he looked back up at the guards. They were all smiling now. The little boy was amazed. "Who are you?" asked the little boy in astonishment. "Why, I'm the king's son. You can enter the castle and be with the king." Said the man. The little boy broke into a huge smile.             question:             According to the passage, the man is  _  .             options:             ['A. kind', 'B. ambitious', 'C. stupid', 'D. mean']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option best describes the man according to the passage, let's analyze his behavior and role:
1. The man notices the little boy crying and stops to ask him what's wrong. This indicates concern and empathy, characteristics of someone who is kind.
2. He listens to the boy's story and offers to help by suggesting they both try to approach the castle again, showing willingness to assist, which is also a sign of kindness.
3. When the boy expresses concern about the man getting hurt by the guards, the man reassures him and continues on, implying courage and compassion.
4. It is revealed that the man is the king's son, which explains why the guards let them pass. His status as the king's son and his willingness to help the boy demonstrate kindness, as he uses his position to assist someone in need without expecting anything in return.
Considering the given options:
- A. kind: The man's actions and attitude align well with being kind.
- B. ambitious: There's no indication in the passage that the man is driven by ambition.
- C. stupid: The man does not exhibit any foolish or irrational behavior; he acts with understanding and authority.
- D. mean: The man's behavior is the opposite of mean; he is courteous and helpful.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A. Kind.

Q: article:             Fear is an emotion like others such as happiness, anger, hurt, sadness. We need emotions to process information we receive and decide how to respond. Being afraid of fast cars, for example, is something that might protect us from harm. Being afraid of the consequence of a choice may prevent us getting into trouble. Fears in young children commonly center on certain animals like snakes or big dogs. Fears are caused often because of experiences or ideas expressed by others, and at times, the media. Many normal fears during the early years, like men with beards, or large dogs, disappear with age. Those relating to personal failure and ridicule   remain through adulthood and may need special help to overcome. Children's fears are often _ , but that doesn't mean they should be ignored. They need to be recognized and accepted as real for that child. Only when we help children understand their fears can they grow normally in their ability to deal with them. Research shows that as a child grows up, the center of his fears changes a lot. Things like divorce, a teacher who "shouted at me", people with guns, bullies, big boys, or "making fun of me" top the list of childhood fears. We can not always prevent these experiences from happening, but it's essential that children be allowed to freely express their emotions without judgment. Sympathy and a caring listener will help ease the pain of these fears. Read books and stories to your child about children who have experienced similar fears. This helps children talk about their fears and find ways to cope. With all emotions, fears become less of a problem for children as they gain self-confidence and they find that fear is normal and can be dealt with.             question:             In dealing with children's fears, the final goal of the parents is to   _  .             options:             ['A. stop unpleasant experiences happening to children', 'B. let children know about the nature of fear', 'C. create an environment where there is nothing to fear', "D. develop children's ability to treat their fear on their own"]
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the final goal of the parents in dealing with children's fears, let's analyze the options in the context of the provided article:
1. **Option A: "stop unpleasant experiences happening to children"**  
   The article mentions that we cannot always prevent unpleasant experiences (such as divorce, bullying, etc.) from happening to children. Therefore, this option is not the focus of the article in terms of the final goal.
2. **Option B: "let children know about the nature of fear"**  
   While understanding the nature of fear can be part of dealing with fears, the article emphasizes helping children talk about and cope with their fears. The explanation of fear is not mentioned as the ultimate goal.
3. **Option C: "create an environment where there is nothing to fear"**  
   The article does not suggest that the goal is to eliminate all sources of fear. Instead, it acknowledges that fears are a part of life and normal development.
4. **Option D: "develop children's ability to treat their fear on their own"**  
   The article stresses the importance of helping children understand their fears and develop coping strategies. It also highlights the role of gaining self-confidence in dealing with fear, suggesting that the ultimate goal is to empower children to manage
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we must carefully analyze the passage and the provided options:
1. **Understanding Fear in Context**: The passage discusses the nature of fear as an emotion that can serve protective purposes. It notes how some fears disappear with age, while others persist into adulthood and may need special intervention.
2. **Analyzing the Passage**:

   - It also highlights the importance of recognizing and responding to children's fears to help them manage these emotions.
   - The passage suggests methods such as reading stories about similar fears to help children cope.
   - It concludes by emphasizing that as children gain self-confidence, fear becomes less of a problem.
3. **Evaluating the Options**:

How to Overcome Children's Fears", "B. Children's Fears", "C. The kind of Children's Fears", 'D. The Bad Effects of Fears']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage discusses the nature of fears in children, their causes, and the importance of addressing these fears so that children can grow and learn to cope with them. It emphasizes that fears are a normal part of childhood development and offers suggestions on how adults can help children deal with them effectively.
- Option A, "How to Overcome Children's Fears," suggests a focus specifically on methods to overcome fears, but the passage covers broader topics about the nature and impact of fears, not just overcoming them.
- Option B, "Children's Fears," is a general title which fits well because the passage broadly discusses children's fears, their causes, evolution, and ways to deal with them.
- Option C, "The kind of Children's Fears," implies a focus on categorizing or listing different kinds of fears, but the article is more comprehensive, addressing not just types but also ways to handle and understand fears.
- Option D, "The Bad Effects of Fears," implies a negative focus on the consequences of fear, which is not the main subject of the passage.
Given these considerations, the best title for the passage is Option B, "Children's Fears," because it accurately reflects the overall content and focus of the article.

Q: article:             While sweet treats can be hard to resist, the World Health Organization(WHO) has set new guidelines for people around the world. The guidelines, released on Wednesday, advise that both adults and children cut back on their sugar intake  to stay healthy. In a statement, Francesco Branca, director of the WHO's nutrition department, said there is evidence that reducing daily sugar intake reduces the risk of being overweight and tooth decay . The guidelines do not apply to the sugars in fresh fruit and vegetables or those that are naturally present in milk. According to the WHO, there is no reported evidence of negative effects of consuming those sugars. Instead, the new guidelines focus on "added" or "free" sugars. These include sugars that are added to processed foods and drinks such as candy and soft drinks. Added sugars are sometimes described as " hidden" sugars because they exist in foods we might not think of as sweets, such as honey and ketchup . Health experts advise that consumers look at ingredients on food packages to help make better-informed decisions. The WHO recommends that people in the United States, Europe and other Western societies should cut their average sugar intake by about two-thirds, or down to just 10% of their overall calories. For developing countries, where dental care is less advanced, the WHO recommends that sugar intake be reduced to 5%. Scientist Kieran Clarke, of the University of Oxford, notes that for those people who can't shake their love for sweets, getting more exercise is a good solution. "If you get enough exercise, you can eat almost anything," she said "But it's very hard to avoid large amounts of sugar unless all you're eating is fruit and vegetables."             question:             What can we learn from the guidelines released by the World Health Organization?             options:             ['A. The production of candies should be forbidden.', 'B. There is a connection between sugar intake and bad teeth.', 'C. Fruit and vegetables contain a lot of sugar.', 'D. People should cut down on sugar intake for the sake of their health.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we can learn from the guidelines released by the World Health Organization (WHO), let's analyze the information provided:
1. The WHO advises that both adults and children reduce their sugar intake to stay healthy.
2. Evidence suggests that reducing daily sugar intake decreases the risk of being overweight and experiencing tooth decay.
3. The guidelines do not apply to sugars found naturally in fresh fruits, vegetables, and milk because there is no evidence of negative effects from consuming those sugars.
4. The focus is on "added" or "free" sugars, such as those found in processed foods and drinks.
5. The WHO recommends significant reductions in sugar intake, especially in Western societies and developing countries.
Now, let's consider each option in turn:
- Option A: "The production of candies should be forbidden." This does not align with the guidelines, as there is no mention of banning candy production; the advice is about reducing consumption.
- Option B: "There is a connection between sugar intake and bad teeth." The article mentions that reducing sugar intake can reduce the risk of tooth decay, indicating a connection.
- Option C: "Fruit and vegetables contain a lot of sugar." The guidelines specifically state that the sugars in fresh fruits and vegetables are not the focus, and there are no reported

A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks to what level people in developing countries should cut down their sugar intake according to the WHO. 
1. From the information given in the article, the World Health Organization (WHO) provides guidelines for sugar reduction aiming for healthier lifestyles.
2. The article specifies that the WHO recommends people in developing countries reduce their sugar intake more than those in developed countries.
3. Specifically, the WHO suggests that for developing countries, sugar intake should be reduced to 5% of their overall calories.
Considering the provided options, we can identify the correct answer:
- Option A: 10%.
- Option B: 15%.

To answer the question, we need to evaluate each of the provided options based on the information given in the article.
1. **Option A**: "added sugar isn't marked on food packages"
   - The article advises that consumers look at ingredients on food packages to help make better-informed decisions. This implies added sugars can be identified on food packages, making option A incorrect.
2. **Option B**: "we should drink as little milk as possible as it contains sugar"
   - The article mentions that the guidelines do not apply to sugars naturally present in milk and that there is no reported evidence of negative effects from these sugars. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.
3. **Option C**: "soft drinks don't contain added sugar"
   - The article states explicitly that added or "free" sugars include those added to processed foods and drinks such as soft drinks. Therefore, option C is incorrect.
4. **Option D**: "the less exercise you do, the fewer sweet things you should eat"
   - The article includes a statement by scientist Kieran Clarke, noting, "If you get enough exercise, you can eat almost anything." This suggests that someone who doesn't exercise as much should be mindful of their sugar intake, aligning option D with the article

Q: article:             Jimmy is an automotive mechanic, but he lost his job a few months ago. He has a good heart, but always feared applying for a new job. One day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appointment was at 10 am and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus to the office where he was supposed to be interviewed, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tyre of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man asked him how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said, "Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist." Jimmy agreed. Upon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Jimmy still had some grease on him after the car repair, but he did not have much time to wash it off or have a change of shirt. One by one, the applicants left the interviewer's office with disappointed look on their faces. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked, "Do you really need to be interviewed?" Jimmy's heart sank. "With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?" he thought to himself. Then the interviewer turned the chair and to Jimmy's surprise, it was the old man he helped earlier in the morning. It turned out he was the General Manager of the company. "Sorry I had to keep you waiting, but I was pretty sure I made the right decision to have you as part of our workforce before you even stepped into the office. I just know you'd be a trustworthy worker. Congratulations!" Jimmy sat down and they shared a cup of well-deserved coffee as he landed himself a new job.             question:             Why did Jimmy apply for a new job?             options:             ['A. He was out of work', 'B. He was bored with his job', 'C. He wanted a higher position', 'D. He hoped to find a better boss']
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand why Jimmy applied for a new job, we need to consider the details provided in the article:
1. **Jimmy's Situation:** The article begins by noting that Jimmy is an automotive mechanic who lost his job a few months ago. This clearly sets up the context that he is currently out of work.
2. **Reason for Change:** There's no mention in the article about Jimmy being bored with his previous job, wanting a higher position, or hoping to find a better boss. The focus is solely on the fact that he is out of work.
3. **Conclusion:** Given the information in the article, the primary reason for Jimmy applying for a new job is that he has been unemployed for a few months and is seeking new employment to rectify that situation.
Therefore, the most appropriate answer is: **A. He was out of work**.

A: Let's think step by step.
Jimmy was on his way to a job interview when he noticed an elderly man having trouble with his car. The article mentions that the elderly man was "wildly kicking the tyre of his car" indicating that there was something wrong with the car and it wasn't working properly. This implies that the old man's car had broken down. 
Therefore, when considering the options:
- "A. A friend's car had a flat tyre" is incorrect because there is no mention of the car belonging to a friend or having a flat tyre specifically.
- "B. a wild man was pushing a car" is incorrect since there is no mention of anyone pushing the car; the elderly man was kicking the tyre.
- "C. a terrible accident happened" is incorrect as no accident is described in the article.
- "D. an old man's car broke down" is correct as it aligns with the situation described where the elderly man needed help with his car.
The correct answer is: "D. an old man's car broke down"
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D

Q: article:             Jimmy is an automotive mechanic, but he lost his job a few months ago. He has a good heart, but always feared applying for a new job. One day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appointment was at 10 am and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus to the office where he was supposed to be interviewed, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tyre of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man asked him how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said, "Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist." Jimmy agreed. Upon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Jimmy still had some grease on him after the car repair, but he did not have much time to wash it off or have a change of shirt. One by one, the applicants left the interviewer's office with disappointed look on their faces. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked, "Do you really need to be interviewed?" Jimmy's heart sank. "With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?" he thought to himself. Then the interviewer turned the chair and to Jimmy's surprise, it was the old man he helped earlier in the morning. It turned out he was the General Manager of the company. "Sorry I had to keep you waiting, but I was pretty sure I made the right decision to have you as part of our workforce before you even stepped into the office. I just know you'd be a trustworthy worker. Congratulations!" Jimmy sat down and they shared a cup of well-deserved coffee as he landed himself a new job.             question:             Why did the old man offer Jimmy a ride?             options:             ['A. He was also to be interviewed', 'B. He needed a traveling companion', 'C. He always helped people in need', 'D. He was thankful to Jimmy']
A: Let's think step by step.
1. The context of the article tells us that the old man had car trouble, and Jimmy stopped to help him fix his car without expecting any payment.
2. After Jimmy helped the old man, the old man learned that Jimmy was rushing to a job interview.
3. Out of gratitude for Jimmy's kind and selfless help, the old man offered to give Jimmy a ride to his interview as a way to thank him.
4. The old man specifically said, "Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist," which clearly indicates that he was thankful for Jimmy's help.
Based on this information, the most appropriate answer to why the old man offered Jimmy a ride is:
D. He was thankful to Jimmy.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D.

He was sorry for the other applicants', 'B. There was no hope for him to get the job', 'C. He regretted helping the old man', 'D. The interviewer was very rude']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how Jimmy felt on hearing the interviewer's question, it's important to consider the context provided in the story.
1. **Jimmy's Initial Feelings:** Before entering the interview, Jimmy was likely feeling nervous and possibly self-conscious. He was aware that he was not in his best attire and still had grease on him from helping the elderly man.
2. **Observing the Applicants:** He saw other applicants leaving the interview room with disappointed looks on their faces, which might have contributed to his anxiety and expectation of rejection.
3. **The Interviewer's Question:** When the interviewer asked, "Do you really need to be interviewed?" it initially caused Jimmy's heart to sink. This suggests that he interpreted the question negatively, leading him to feel discouraged.
4. **Jimmy's Interpretation of the Situation:** Given his appearance, the context of other candidates leaving disappointed, and the phrasing of the question, Jimmy likely felt that there was little hope for him to get the job. He might have thought that his current appearance or something about his situation was being judged negatively.
Based on this detailed analysis, the most suitable option that captures Jimmy's feelings upon hearing the interviewer's question is:
**B. There was no hope for him to get the job.**
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B

Where there is a will, there's a way", 'B. A friend in need is a friend indeed', 'C. Good is rewarded with good.', 'D. Two heads are better than one']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we can learn from Jimmy's experience, let's consider each option in the context of the story:
- **A. Where there is a will, there's a way**: This suggests perseverance and determination lead to success. While Jimmy did gather his courage to attend the interview, the main lesson isn't focused on that aspect but rather on an unexpected turn of events.
- **B. A friend in need is a friend indeed**: This implies that true friends are those who help you when you're in trouble. The story isn't mainly about friendship but about an act of kindness to a stranger.
- **C. Good is rewarded with good**: In the story, Jimmy helps the elderly man without expecting anything in return. As a consequence, the elderly man, who turns out to be the General Manager, rewards Jimmy by giving him the job. This directly illustrates the concept of karma or reciprocity, where Jimmy's good deed led to a beneficial outcome.
- **D. Two heads are better than one**: This means that collaborating with others can lead to better results. The story does not involve collaboration or teamwork.
Based on this analysis, the story primarily illustrates that acts of kindness and selflessness can lead to positive outcomes, aligning with option C. Therefore, the lesson
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. Good is rewarded with good.

Q: article:             When Gretchen Baxter gets home from work as a New York City book editor, she checks her Blackberry at the door. "I think we are attached to these devices in a way that is not always positive," says Baxter, who'd rather focus at home on her husband and 12-year-old daughter. "It's there and it beckons . That's human nature (but)...we kind of get crazy sometimes and we don't know where it should stop." Americans are connected at unprecedented  levels--93% now use cell phones or wireless devices; one third of those are "smart phones" that allow users to browse the web and check e-mails, among other things. The benefits are obvious: checking messages on the road, staying in touch with friends and family, efficiently using time once spent waiting around. The _ : often, we're effectively disconnecting from those in the same room. That's why, despite all the technology that makes communicating easier than ever, 2010 was the year we stopped talking to one another. From texting at dinner to posting on Facebook from work or checking e-mails while on a date, the connectivity revolution is creating a lot of divided attention, not to mention social anxiety. Many analysts say it's time to step back and reassess  . "What we're going to see in the future is new opportunities for people to be plugged in and connected like never before," says Scott Campbell. "It can be a good thing, but I also see new ways the traditional social construction is getting somewhat torn apart." Our days are filled with beeps and pings--many of which pull us away from tasks at hand or face-to-face conversations. We may feel that the distractions  are too much, but we can't seem to stop posting, texting or surfing. "We're going through a period of adjustment and rebalancing, " says Sherry Turkle and she wants to remind people that technology can be turned off. "Our human purposes are to really have connections with people," she says. "We have to reclaim it. It's not going to take place by itself."             question:             Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?             options:             ['A. The wide use of mobile devices has nothing to do with the traditional social construction.', 'B. Mobile devices play a less important part in American life.', 'C. Mobile devices create a lot of divided attention and social anxiety.', 'D. Many analysts speak highly of the wide popularity of mobile devices.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true according to the passage, let's examine each option in relation to the content of the passage:
A. "The wide use of mobile devices has nothing to do with the traditional social construction."
- The passage mentions that the traditional social construction is somewhat being torn apart by new ways of staying connected through mobile devices. Thus, the use of mobile devices is indeed affecting the traditional social construction. Therefore, option A is not true.
B. "Mobile devices play a less important part in American life."
- The passage highlights how mobile devices are widely used in America (93% usage) and discusses the benefits such as staying in touch and using time efficiently. This implies that mobile devices play a significant role in American life, not a less important one. So, option B is not true.
C. "Mobile devices create a lot of divided attention and social anxiety."
- The passage specifically states that the connectivity revolution is creating a lot of divided attention and mentions social anxiety as well. Therefore, option C is mentioned directly in the passage and is true.
D. "Many analysts speak highly of the wide popularity of mobile devices."
- While the passage mentions that there are obvious benefits to using mobile devices, it also emphasizes the negative aspects such as divided attention and social
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. Mobile devices create a lot of divided attention and social anxiety.

Q: article:             No one really knows how the ancient Egyptians build the pyramids. But Maureen Clemmons has a theory  . She thinks the Egyptians may have used kites. "If you look at ht top center of every monument  , you see wings," Clemons said. "I think the Egyptians have been trying to tell us in pictures for 3,000 years that this is how they built the pyramids." She thinks that earliest Egyptian workers might make use of kites to lift the stones with the help of the desert wind. She got a team of aeronautic   engineers to help her test the theory. Yesterday, in the Mojave Desert, they put their theory to the test using a nylon kite, three pulleys   and an obelisk   that weighs nearly four tons. The wind speed had to be just right. And amazingly, it worked. "There's  ly no evidence  for kites in ancient Egypt," said Professor Carol Redmount of the University of California. "There's no evidence of pulleys as we know them today." Redmount says the historical evidence points to the "Charlton Heston method," which basically relies on the theory of the muscle of slaves pushing and pulling huge stone blocks to create the pyramids.  But the kite-lifting group will have none that. "All I can remember from history is that Egyptians drank beer for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and as someone who has done field research on drinking beer, I know after I've had two beers and it's really hot. I'm not pushing or pulling anything," Clemmons said. "So, I figured I'd try to think another way."             question:             How did Clemmons prove that her idea was reasonable?             options:             ['A. She built a pyramid by using kites', 'B. She had an argument with Professor Redmount.', 'C. She persuaded a team of aeronautic engineers to test her idea.', 'D. She had an experiment done to lift a large stone by using pulleys and a kite.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how Maureen Clemmons proved that her idea was reasonable, we need to examine the actions she took based on the article:
1. **Theory Development**: Clemmons developed a theory that the ancient Egyptians might have used kites to help construct the pyramids.
   
2. **The Experiment**: She collaborated with a team of aeronautic engineers to test her theory. They conducted an experiment in the Mojave Desert using a nylon kite, three pulleys, and an obelisk weighing nearly four tons.
3. **Outcome of the Experiment**: The test was successful when they used the kite and pulleys to lift the heavy obelisk with the assistance of the wind.
Evaluating the options:
- **Option A**: She did not build a pyramid using kites. The experiment was limited to lifting a single large stone (obelisk), not constructing a pyramid.
- **Option B**: While there might have been a disagreement with Professor Redmount, such a debate does not constitute proof of Clemmons’s theory.
- **Option C**: Although she did persuade engineers to help test her idea, this action alone doesn't prove her idea. The proof lies in the successful outcome of the test.
- **Option D**
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. She had an experiment done to lift a large stone by using pulleys and a kite.'

The discovery of pulleys.', 'C. The wings on the monuments.', 'D. The Charlton Heston method.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what made Clemmons think of her kite-lifting idea, let's analyze the information given in the article:
1. Clemmons mentions seeing something significant in the monuments. She states, "If you look at the top center of every monument, you see wings." This suggests that she observed depictions of wings on the ancient Egyptian monuments which inspired her kite theory.
2. The context provided indicates that Clemmons' theory revolves around the concept of using kites to lift heavy stones with the aid of wind. Her observations of wings on monuments led her to speculate that they might symbolize or allude to a method involving aerial lifting.
3. The article does not mention Clemmons having a job related to making kites, the discovery of pulleys, or being influenced directly by the Charlton Heston method. Instead, her comments on the wings suggest a more direct connection to her development of the kite-lifting theory.
Based on the analysis above, the correct option that made Clemmons think of her kite-lifting idea is:
C. The wings on the monuments.

Because there were no enough slaves to finish the great project.', 'D. Because she knew Charlton Heston very well.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Maureen Clemmons did not agree with the traditional theory that the pyramids were built using the muscle of slaves, we need to examine the reasons mentioned in the article.
The article provides a quote from Clemmons that gives an insight into her reasoning: she recalls that Egyptians drank beer for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and from her own experience with drinking beer, she concluded that after having two beers in hot weather, she would not be inclined to push or pull anything. This suggests that she found it unlikely that people could perform such hard labor under those conditions.
Now, let's evaluate the options given:
- Option A: "Because at that time no pulleys were used in Egypt." This is not directly related to Clemmons' reasoning for not agreeing with the slave labor theory.
  
- Option B: "Because of the Egyptians' habit of drinking beer at three meals and the beer effect on people." This matches directly with Clemmons' reasoning as stated in the article. She referred to her belief that consuming beer, as she understood it, would not be conducive to performing hard labor.
  
- Option C: "Because there were no enough slaves to finish the great project." The article does not mention Clemmons using this as a
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. Because of the Egyptians' habit of drinking beer at three meals and the beer effect on people.

Two Different Theories', 'C. Kites and Pyramids', 'D. Kites and Pulleys']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, we need to analyze the main focus of the text:
1. **Main Topic**: The passage discusses a theory proposed by Maureen Clemmons that ancient Egyptians might have used kites to build the pyramids. It contrasts this idea with the traditional view that slaves used muscle power to move the stones.
2. **Kites and Pulleys**: The passage describes an experiment using kites and pulleys to lift a heavy obelisk as a test of Clemmons' theory.
3. **Two Theories**: The text also mentions another theory, the "Charlton Heston method," as an alternative to the kite theory, presenting a comparison between two ideas.
Now, let’s evaluate the options:
- **A. An Unknown Mystery**: This is too vague and does not specifically relate to the main content of the passage, which is about theories of pyramid construction, specifically involving kites.
- **B. Two Different Theories**: This title captures the contrast between Clemmons' kite theory and the traditional slave labor theory, highlighting the presence of two competing explanations.
- **C. Kites and Pyramids**: This option focuses on the primary subject introduced by Clemmons

Q: article:             He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. "He should be punished for the killings," an Israeli official said, "He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups." But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: "They can kill me, but never get me out of my country." He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards  _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel.  All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell.             question:             According to the passage, which statement is true?             options:             ["A. In 1992, Arafat's plane crashed in South Africa.", 'B. Israeli officers thought Arafat himself sent the terrorist groups to Israel.', "C. China is the only country against Israel's decision of removing Arafat.", 'D. Being Palestinian leader, Arafat would rather die in his own country than be driven away from his people.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true according to the passage, let's evaluate each option based on the information provided:
A. "In 1992, Arafat's plane crashed in South Africa."
- The passage states that the aircraft in which Arafat was flying crashed over North Africa. Therefore, this option is incorrect because it specifies South Africa, not North Africa.
B. "Israeli officers thought Arafat himself sent the terrorist groups to Israel."
- The passage mentions that an Israeli official said Arafat should be punished for the killings and that he has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups. However, it does not explicitly state that Israeli officers believed Arafat himself sent the terrorist groups. This option is misleading.
C. "China is the only country against Israel's decision of removing Arafat."
- The passage states that China opposed Israel's decision and mentions that other governments share this idea, indicating that China is not the only country against the decision. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
D. "Being Palestinian leader, Arafat would rather die in his own country than be driven away from his people."
- The passage includes a quote from Arafat saying, "They can kill me, but never get me out of my country," which

Q: article:             He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. "He should be punished for the killings," an Israeli official said, "He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups." But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: "They can kill me, but never get me out of my country." He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards  _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel.  All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell.             question:             What did the author mean by saying "just like a cat has nine lives" when he talked about Arafat?             options:             ['A. Arafat is as clever as a cat.', 'B. Arafat can live as long as a cat.', 'C. Arafat can stay alive after accidents or disasters as if he has nine lives.', 'D. Arafat should have died for at least 8 times.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The phrase "just like a cat has nine lives" is an idiomatic expression used to describe someone who has narrowly escaped death or danger multiple times, much like the folklore belief that cats have nine lives due to their ability to survive accidents that would seriously injure other animals. The context provided in the article details multiple occasions where Yasser Arafat faced grave danger but managed to come out unscathed each time. 
Let's evaluate each option:
- **A. Arafat is as clever as a cat.**: The statement does not emphasize Arafat's cleverness but rather his survival through dangerous situations. Therefore, this option is not correct.
- **B. Arafat can live as long as a cat.**: The phrase is not about lifespan but rather about surviving dangerous situations repeatedly. Therefore, this option is not correct.
- **C. Arafat can stay alive after accidents or disasters as if he has nine lives.**: This option accurately reflects the meaning of "just like a cat has nine lives," as it emphasizes his ability to survive multiple life-threatening situations.
- **D. Arafat should have died for at least 8 times.**: While this statement touches on the aspect of surviving many times, it does
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. Arafat can stay alive after accidents or disasters as if he has nine lives.

Hopeful.', 'B. Interesting.', 'C. Satisfactory.', 'D. Doubtful.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the writer's attitude towards Arafat's future, we need to analyze the last sentence of the passage: "But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell."
1. The phrase "has he used up the last of his nine lives?" suggests that the writer is contemplating the possibility that Arafat's luck or ability to survive dangerous situations might be running out. This implies an element of uncertainty about his future safety.
2. "Only time will tell" reinforces this uncertainty. It indicates that the future is unpredictable and that we must wait and see what will happen to Arafat.
3. Considering the options:
   - 'A. Hopeful.': For this option to be correct, the writer would need to express optimism about Arafat's future. The passage does not indicate optimism but rather uncertainty.
   - 'B. Interesting.': This option suggests the writer finds Arafat's situation curious or engaging, but it doesn't precisely capture the sense of uncertainty conveyed.
   - 'C. Satisfactory.': This option would imply a sense of contentment or acceptance, which is not conveyed in the passage since the outcome is uncertain.
   - 'D. Doubtful.': This option fits the
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. Doubtful.'

Q: article:             The Red Sea is parting again, but this time no one can help. Satellite pictures show that the Arabian plate and the African plate are moving away from each other, stretching the Earth's crust and widening the southern end of the Red Sea. Last September, series of earthquakes started splitting the planet's surface in Ethiopia. Over a period of three weeks, the sides on the rift separated by 26 feet. "We think that the crust is melted slowly at depths greater than 10 kilometers, where it is hotter, forming molten rock," said Tim J Wright. "This molten rock rises through the crust because it is less dense than the surrounding rock." The molten rock collects at depths of 3 to 5 kilometers. Wright explained, "Slowly, the pressure has been building up until last September when it finally cracked, breaking the crust." The entry of molten rock into the gap between continents, rather than the cracking of the crust, is responsible for separation of continent drifts. For the past 30 million years Africa and Arabia have been going through the continental rifting process, the same one that made the Red Sea part again. "The ground is continually moving---much more rapidly now than before," Wright said. "On average, the two sides move apart at about 2 centimeters per year." This latest split, added to the long-term rifting process could eventually create a huge new sea. Although such processes could take millions of years to occur, this event has given scientists an opportunity to examine the break in real time.             question:             According to the passage, what caused Arabia separate from Africa?             options:             ['A. A series of earthquakes.', 'B. Molten rock flowing into the continental gap.', 'C. The cracking of the crust.', 'D. The pressure under the ground.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage describes a geological process known as continental rifting, which is responsible for the separation between the Arabian plate and the African plate. The key elements involved in this process include:
1. **Molten Rock Movement**: The passage states that molten rock rises through the Earth's crust because it is less dense than the surrounding rock. This molten rock collects at depths of 3 to 5 kilometers below the surface. 
2. **Pressure Build-up**: Over time, pressure builds up as the molten rock accumulates.
3. **Crust Cracking**: Eventually, the pressure becomes so great that it causes the Earth's crust to crack.
4. **Molten Rock Entry**: After the crust cracks, molten rock flows into the newly created gap, which is critical for the separation of the continents.
The question asks what caused Arabia to separate from Africa. According to the passage, the entry of molten rock into the gap between the continents is primarily responsible for the separation:
- The statement "The entry of molten rock into the gap between continents, rather than the cracking of the crust, is responsible for separation of continent drifts," directly suggests that the key factor for the separation is the molten rock flowing into the gap.
Now, let's evaluate the options given:
-
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. Molten rock flowing into the continental gap.

A: Let's think step by step.
To find the main topic of the passage, let's break down the information provided:
1. **Introduction to Geological Activity:**
   - The passage begins by mentioning that the Red Sea is "parting again" due to geological activity, specifically the movement of the Arabian and African plates away from each other.
2. **Details on Geological Processes:**
   - It describes a series of earthquakes in Ethiopia which have contributed to the separation of these tectonic plates.
   - The passage explains how molten rock from the Earth’s mantle rises through the crust, causing the crust to crack and contributing to the movement apart of these plates.
3. **Historical Context and Future Implications:**
   - The movement is part of a long-term continental rifting process ongoing for 30 million years, which could eventually lead to the formation of a new sea.
4. **Understanding of Scientific Observations:**
   - Scientists now have an opportunity to study these processes in real-time due to the recent notable geological activities.
Now, let's evaluate the answer options in the context of these points:
- **A. the earthquakes in Ethiopia:** The earthquakes are a part of the information, but they are not the main topic. They are discussed as part of the process causing the Red Sea to widen,
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. the cause why the Red Sea is parting again.

For little money, people could forget their unhappy lives and dream of better ones. In the years between 1918 and 1939, going to the cinema became the most popular family free-time activity. Hollywood in America, made more films than any other film center in the world. The warm climate and long hours of sunlight meant that film-making was easy and quite cheap. This was also a rich part of America and there were many businessmen who wanted to make money from the film industry. At first short cowboy films were popular because they added excitement and adventure to people's lives. Later comedy films were made so that people could laugh and forget their troubles. Charlie Chaplin was probably the most liked of all comedy actors.             question:             Cinema became the most popular in people's free time because  _  .             options:             ['A. it was cheap', 'B. it was safe', 'C. it could make people happy', 'D. both A and C']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why cinema became the most popular activity in people's free time, let's examine the key points in the article:
1. **Affordability**: The article mentions "for little money, people could forget their unhappy lives and dream of better ones," indicating that cinema was affordable, which made it accessible to a wide audience.
2. **Happiness and Escapism**: The article states that people were looking for a better and happier world after the war and that cinema provided an escape from their unhappy lives. It allowed people to dream of better lives and forget their troubles. Comedy films, in particular, were mentioned as a means for people to laugh and forget their problems.
So, the reasoning here is that the cinema provided two significant benefits: it was affordable and it provided an emotional escape and happiness during tough times.
3. **Other Options**: There is no mention of safety (Option B) in the text being a factor for the popularity of cinema during this time.
Given this analysis, the reasons why cinema became the most popular free-time activity are because it was cheap (Option A) and it could make people happy (Option C).

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Hollywood became a film center, we need to consider the key factors mentioned in the article that contributed to its development as such.
1. The article mentions that "The warm climate and long hours of sunlight meant that film-making was easy and quite cheap." This suggests that the weather conditions in Hollywood were favorable for film production, making it less expensive and more convenient to produce films there. This is a strong factor for making film-making cheap and easy, which is reflected in option A.
2. Option B states the reason as "it enjoyed long hours of sunlight." While this is mentioned in the article as a contributing factor, it is part of the larger context of why filmmaking was cheap and easy. Therefore, while true, it alone is not the complete reason as it is inherently tied to the aspect mentioned in option A.
3. Option C cites "it was a rich part of America." The article mentions this but in the context of there being many businessmen present who were interested in investing in the film industry. While being a rich area could contribute to having the resources and infrastructure available, it does not directly address why it became a film center in terms of production advantages.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what a "comedy" is, we need to consider the context provided in the article. In the passage, it's mentioned that after the war, people sought to escape their unhappy lives, and the cinema offered a way to do so. Comedy films were produced to allow people to "laugh and forget their troubles." From this context, we can infer that "comedy" is associated with making people laugh and providing amusement.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- A. funny: This aligns with the idea of making people laugh and providing amusement.
- B. exciting: While comedies can be exciting, this doesn't capture the primary essence of comedy, which is being humorous or funny.
- C. full of danger: This is more aligned with thrillers or action films, not comedies.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine Henry's reaction when the gorilla came into the restaurant, let's analyze the relevant details from the article:
1. **Henry's Past Experiences**: The article describes Henry as a seasoned journalist who had experienced and reported on numerous extraordinary and dramatic events during his career. He had seen wars, natural disasters, accidents, crimes, and strange events, which contributed to his claim that nothing surprised him.
2. **Henry's Current Attitude**: After retiring from journalism, Henry spent his time managing a high-end restaurant. He continued to maintain his demeanor of being unsurprised by most occurrences, which aligns with his past experiences.
3. **The Gorilla's Entrance**: When the gorilla walked into the restaurant, the text specifically mentions that Henry "showed no surprise." It states that Henry treated the gorilla politely and acted as though there was nothing unusual about having a gorilla in his restaurant.
4. **Interaction with the Gorilla**: Henry personally served the gorilla, indicating that he was calm and composed, rather than showing fear or surprise.
Given these observations, the most accurate description of Henry’s reaction is that he was not disturbed by the gorilla. He maintained his usual calm demeanor and did not display any surprise, fear, or unusual interest
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. not disturbed by the gorilla.

Q: article:             Henry had been a journalist for many years. He had worked on many international newspapers and magazines and traveled all over the world. Henry had _ wars and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and erupting volcanos . He had reported on serious accidents such as major fires and airline crashes. He had seen every kind of terrible crime and strange event there was. He had met and written about some of the most unusual people in the world. In fact, there wasn't much that Henry had not seen or done. Now he was retired from journalism. He owned a very expensive restaurant and spent his days talking to his wealthy and important customers. He liked to say that nothing surprised him. One day he was sitting at the bar in his restaurant when a big gorilla walked in and asked for a table. Henry showed no surprise. He took the gorilla to a table and handed him a menu. He treated him politely and pretended there was nothing at all strange about having a gorilla in his restaurant. The gorilla looked through the menu and ordered a salad. Henry served the gorilla his salad personally, knowing that his waiters and waitresses would be too frightened. At last the gorilla finished his salad and asked for the bill. Henry wrote out the bill and handed it to the big animal. The gorilla studied it, shook his head sadly, then gave Henry fifty dollars. "Thank you", Henry said, and then to make conversation he added, "We don't get many gorillas in this restaurant." "At fifty dollars for a salad," the gorilla said, "I'm not surprised."             question:             From the sentence "Henry served the gorilla his salad personally, knowing that his waiters and waitresses would be too frightened" you learn that:   _  .             options:             ['A. His staff were not brave people', "B. Henry didn't normally serve customers", 'C. The gorilla had eaten there before', 'D. The gorilla was careful with his money']
A: Let's think step by step.
Certainly! To answer the question, we need to analyze the sentence: "Henry served the gorilla his salad personally, knowing that his waiters and waitresses would be too frightened." 
1. **Understanding the Context**:
    - Henry, a seasoned journalist, is now the owner of a restaurant. 
    - A gorilla, an unusual and possibly intimidating customer, enters the restaurant.
    - Henry handles the situation himself because he presumes the staff would be scared.
2. **Analyzing Each Option**:
    - **A. His staff were not brave people**: This option directly relates to the sentence. The sentence suggests Henry's belief that the presence of a gorilla would frighten his staff, which implies a lack of bravery.
    - **B. Henry didn't normally serve customers**: The sentence does imply that Henry serving personally is out of the ordinary, but the primary focus is on the staff being scared.
    - **C. The gorilla had eaten there before**: There's no indication in the sentence or context that the gorilla is a repeat customer.
    - **D. The gorilla was careful with his money**: This is unrelated to the sentence, which talks about serving the gorilla and concerns about staff fear.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A. His staff were not brave people

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the interactions between Henry and the gorilla.
1. **Context and Details**:
   - Henry is a retired journalist who now owns a fancy restaurant.
   - A gorilla walks into the restaurant and orders a salad, which suggests the gorilla is looking for food.
   - After eating, the gorilla asks for the bill.
2. **Gorilla's Reaction**:
   - The gorilla receives the bill, studies it, and shakes his head sadly before handing Henry fifty dollars.
   - The gorilla then comments, "At fifty dollars for a salad, I'm not surprised."
3. **Understanding the Options**:
   - **A. Angry with the salad**: There's no indication in the text that the gorilla was angry about the salad itself.
   - **B. Still hungry after his salad**: The text does not mention anything about the gorilla's hunger status after eating.
   - **C. Not surprised by the cost of the food**: This option suggests the gorilla expected the price, but this contradicts the gorilla shaking his head sadly and expressing the high price.
   - **D. Surprised by the prices**: The gorilla shakes his head sadly and
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D. Surprised by the prices

Q: article:             At the end of eight grade, our class went to Washington, D.C. For a group of 14-year-olds, this was a big deal! The first day was so tiring; we could hardly remember where we were and what we were seeing. The next morning, we were off to seemonuments ,starting with Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson. We walked along the paths through trees. Then the Wall came into view--the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. As I moved slowly closer to the Wall, I heard abagpipe in the distance, which seemed to show respect to the lives lost in the jungles of Vietnam . We continued walking and felt surprised at the number of names carved in the black stone. I was determined to find a soldier with my last name, but my hunt was stopped when a man caught my eyes. He waskneeling  at the Wall, a single rose at his feet. His head was bowed and he was rubbing his fingers over one name. I thought how sad he was, and then moved on . After a few minutes I found one with my last name, but my eyes returned to the kneeling man. He was still rubbing his fingers over the same name. He never knew I was watching him, lost in deep sorrow. It was time for me to leave the kneeling man and the Wall. On the way home, I couldn't help thinking of the kneeling man and his sad face. I wasn't sure of the effects of war before, but at that moment I realized how much that man suffered from losing his loved one. Maybe he was the only one of so many families who experienced the same . I never knew the full effects of war until I saw that man. I only know about war from history classes. The kneeling man taught me more about war and the effects it has on people than any history book .             question:             Which of the following makes the author feel the suffering that war brings to human beings?             options:             ['A. The kneeling man.', 'B. The sound of a bagpipe.', 'C. The number of names carved in the stone.', 'D. The jungles of Vietnam.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what makes the author feel the suffering that war brings to human beings, we need to identify the key part of the passage that highlights this realization for the author.
1. The paragraph describes the author's visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, known as "the Wall," along with experiences and observations made throughout the visit.
2. Initially, the author describes various elements of the place: the monuments, the sound of a bagpipe in the distance, and the large number of names carved into the black stone.
3. However, the author's attention is significantly drawn to a specific, emotionally impactful scene: a kneeling man who is rubbing his fingers over a name on the Wall, appearing deeply sorrowful. This moment is crucial because it leads the author to reflect on the personal loss and suffering caused by the war.
4. The passage explicitly states: "I wasn't sure of the effects of war before, but at that moment I realized how much that man suffered from losing his loved one." This indicates that the kneeling man is what truly makes the author understand the suffering caused by the war.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:
'A. The kneeling man.'
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the reason why the man continued to rub his fingers over the name on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, we should consider the context provided in the article.
1. **Understanding the setting**: The narrator is visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which is a place to honor those who lost their lives during the Vietnam War. This context alone suggests a significant emotional connection to the names on the Wall for many visitors.
2. **Observing the man's actions**: The man is described as kneeling at the Wall, with his head bowed, and rubbing his fingers over one name. These actions suggest a deep emotional engagement with the name.
3. **Considering the emotional impact**: The man's actions imply a personal and emotional engagement, possibly indicating mourning or remembrance of a lost loved one. The narrator interprets this as sadness and is deeply moved by the man's visible sorrow.
4. **Analyzing the options**:
   - **Option A**: "he found it covered with dust" - This seems unlikely as dust would not typically cause someone to engage in such a deep emotional manner.
   - **Option B**: "he missed the loved one who died in a war" - This aligns with the narrator's interpretation and the context of the Memorial. Rubbing the name

How fierce war is in history.', 'B. How people remember those who died in wars.', 'C. What bad effects war had on many families.', 'D. What we should do to prevent war.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the author learned from the trip, we should focus on the key points discussed in the narrative:
1. **Experience at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial:** The narrative centers around the author's experience at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It's a significant moment for the author, as they observe a man's sorrowful interaction with the Wall.
2. **Observation of Sorrow:** The author witnesses a man kneeling at the Wall, lost in deep sorrow as he rubs his fingers over a name. This moment is deeply impactful for the author.
3. **Realization:** The author reflects on this observation and realizes how deeply war affects individuals and families. Specifically, they acknowledge seeing the tangible effects of war on people, something they hadn't fully understood before this experience.
4. **Conclusion from the Author's Reflection:** The author's reflection suggests a newfound understanding of the emotional and familial toll of war.
Given these points, the best answer is:
**C. What bad effects war had on many families.**
The author learned about the personal and emotional impact of war on individuals and families through their observation at the memorial, more than any historical aspect or prevention strategy.

Q: article:             The air hostess   was in a small kitchen at the back of the plane, preparing the plates for lunch, when a little old lady came and spoke to her, "Could you please tell me," she asked, "where is the ladies' lavatory   in the plane?" "Yes, madam," said the air hostess and smiled. "It is right at the other end of the plane---at the front." The little lady went too far. She walked all the way to the front of the plane, opened the door in front of her, and saw the captain of the plane and the other officers. They were all busy with their work and did not see her. She went out again, shut the door and returned to the air hostess. "Oh, didn't you find it, madam?" the girl asked her. "Yes, I did," said the little lady. "But there are four men in the ladies' lavatory watching television."             question:             The story happened  _  .             options:             ['A. in the evening', 'B. in the afternoon', 'C. in the morning', 'D. at midnight']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the time of day the story happened, we'll look for clues in the narrative itself:
1. **Air Hostess Preparing Lunch**: The air hostess was preparing plates for lunch. This suggests that the event took place around midday. Breakfast would typically be in the morning, and dinner would be in the evening, so lunchtime is around the middle of the day.
2. **Understanding Meal Times**: Lunch is generally served in the afternoon, more specifically around noon to early afternoon.
Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the story happened in the afternoon.
The correct answer is: **B. in the afternoon**.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

"Yes, madam," said the air hostess and smiled. "It is right at the other end of the plane---at the front." The little lady went too far. She walked all the way to the front of the plane, opened the door in front of her, and saw the captain of the plane and the other officers. They were all busy with their work and did not see her. She went out again, shut the door and returned to the air hostess. "Oh, didn't you find it, madam?" the girl asked her. "Yes, I did," said the little lady. "But there are four men in the ladies' lavatory watching television."             question:             What were the four men doing when the little old lady opened the door?             options:             ['A. They were busy working in the control room.', 'B. They were working while watching television.', "C. They were watching television in the ladies' lavatory.", 'D. They were enjoying themselves by watching television.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage describes a situation where a little old lady is searching for the ladies' lavatory in an airplane. The air hostess directs her to the front of the plane. Upon reaching the front, the little lady mistakenly enters the cockpit, where the captain and other officers are located. The passage states that the men in the cockpit were busy with their work when she opened the door. Despite her misunderstanding, the little lady humorously reports back that the men were watching television in the "ladies' lavatory". 
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- A. They were busy working in the control room: This is consistent with the passage. The men were indeed busy with their work in the cockpit, which is essentially the control room.
- B. They were working while watching television: The passage does not mention them watching television, only working.
- C. They were watching television in the ladies' lavatory: This answer reflects the little old lady's humorous misunderstanding, but it is not factually correct according to the situation described.
- D. They were enjoying themselves by watching television: This is not supported by the passage, as it only mentions the men working.
Thus, the correct answer is A. They were busy working in the control room.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true according to the passage, let's analyze each option in relation to the information provided in the story:
1. **Option A: The air hostess was humorous.**
   - The air hostess politely directed the old lady to the location of the ladies' lavatory and smiled. This does not explicitly indicate humor. There is no information in the passage that directly states or implies the air hostess was being humorous.
2. **Option B: The old lady didn't find the ladies' lavatory.**
   - The old lady walked to the front of the plane, opened a door, and mistakenly found herself in the cockpit with the captain and other officers, not the lavatory. Hence, it can be inferred that the old lady did not find the actual ladies' lavatory as she encountered the cockpit instead.
3. **Option C: The old lady was fooled by the air hostess.**
   - The passage does not suggest intentional deception from the air hostess. She gave the old lady the correct general direction, although the old lady ended up in the wrong place perhaps due to misunderstanding or miscommunication.
4. **Option D: There was no ladies' lavatory in the plane.**
   - The passage implies that there is indeed a ladies' lav

Q: article:             Teddy Bears have been a very popular children's toy for many years. Most adults can remember their first stuffed bear, and over the decades these toys have become nearly a symbol of their childhood. However, children are not the only ones with whom these toys have become popular, as many adults make it a habit to collect these toys as well. The Teddy Bear first became popular during the early 20th century and was associated with then President Theodore Roosevelt. The story can date back to a hunting trip that President Roosevelt had taken where he was invited to be the one to shoot a black bear that had been tied to a tree. Being a crazy outdoors lover and hunter, Roosevelt refused to kill the animal because he believed that shooting the helpless bear was unsportsmanlike and wrong. This story quickly spread through newspapers across the country, and in the end inspired the introduction of a stuffed toy called "Teddy's bear". These toys became popular soon after first introduced, and within ten years, they were being produced by dozens of companies around the world. Within a generation, these stuffed bears were "the" toy to have, and have always been within children's toy boxes ever since. They are most often mass-produced in factories in order to keep up with the high demand.  However, there are still companies that take great pride in their handmade designs; and while handmade teddy bears are often preferred, they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones. Today, these bears and other similar toys generate well over a billion dollars a year in profits for the companies that make them. Walk through just about any toy store in America and you will find dozens of different teddy bears lining the shelves.             question:             According to the passage, we can know President Roosevelt    _   .             options:             ["A. didn't like hunting", 'B. enjoy being special', 'C. was not brave enough', 'D. was fair and respectable']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's analyze the information provided in the passage:
1. It mentions President Theodore Roosevelt and a specific incident during a hunting trip. 
2. Roosevelt's reaction to the situation is highlighted - he was invited to shoot a black bear that had been tied to a tree.
3. Despite being an outdoors lover and hunter, Roosevelt refused to kill the helpless bear.
4. The passage notes that Roosevelt believed shooting the bear was unsportsmanlike and wrong.
Now, let's evaluate the options in the context of the information:
- **A. didn't like hunting**: This does not align with the passage because it describes Roosevelt as a "crazy outdoors lover and hunter".
- **B. enjoy being special**: There's no mention or suggestion in the passage that Roosevelt's actions were motivated by a desire to be special.
- **C. was not brave enough**: The passage doesn't imply a lack of bravery; instead, it highlights Roosevelt's ethical considerations against shooting the bear.
- **D. was fair and respectable**: The passage supports this option by emphasizing Roosevelt's belief in fairness (unsportsmanlike) and his respect for the animal's life.
Thus, based on the analysis of the passage, the most accurate answer is **D. was

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the relevant information from the article:
1. The article mentions:
   - "There are still companies that take great pride in their handmade designs; and while handmade teddy bears are often preferred, they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones."
2. Based on this information, we can evaluate the options:
   - Option A: "don't sell well" is not supported by the text. The article states that handmade teddy bears are often preferred, which implies they are valued by consumers.
   - Option B: "are of high quality" could be inferred because they are handmade, but it's not directly stated in the article.
   - Option C: "are more expensive" is directly stated in the line "they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones."
   - Option D: "are preferred by adults" is not supported by the text. The article states they are "often preferred" but does not specify that this preference is exclusive to adults.
3. Since option C is directly supported by the article, it is the most accurate and relevant answer.
Therefore, compared with mass-produced teddy bears, the handmade ones are more expensive. The correct answer is option C.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C

The story can date back to a hunting trip that President Roosevelt had taken where he was invited to be the one to shoot a black bear that had been tied to a tree. Being a crazy outdoors lover and hunter, Roosevelt refused to kill the animal because he believed that shooting the helpless bear was unsportsmanlike and wrong. This story quickly spread through newspapers across the country, and in the end inspired the introduction of a stuffed toy called "Teddy's bear". These toys became popular soon after first introduced, and within ten years, they were being produced by dozens of companies around the world. Within a generation, these stuffed bears were "the" toy to have, and have always been within children's toy boxes ever since. They are most often mass-produced in factories in order to keep up with the high demand.  However, there are still companies that take great pride in their handmade designs; and while handmade teddy bears are often preferred, they are also generally more expensive than their mass-produced ones. Today, these bears and other similar toys generate well over a billion dollars a year in profits for the companies that make them. Walk through just about any toy store in America and you will find dozens of different teddy bears lining the shelves.             question:             What is the passage mainly about?             options:             ['A. History of the Teddy Bear.', 'B. A popular toy -- Teddy Bear.', 'C. Who made the first toy bear?', 'D. Profits Teddy Bear have made.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main topic of the passage, we should examine the key points and themes presented throughout the text.
1. **Introduction of Teddy Bears**: The passage begins by stating that Teddy Bears have been a popular children's toy for many years, indicating the long-standing cultural presence of these toys.
2. **Historical Background**: It provides a historical account of the Teddy Bear's origin, connecting it to President Theodore Roosevelt and explaining how the bear became known as "Teddy's bear." This story is significant in understanding why they are called Teddy Bears and their early popularity.
3. **Popularity Among Adults**: The passage notes that Teddy Bears are not only popular among children but also collected by many adults, showing the toy's widespread appeal.
4. **Commercial Production and Impact**: There is a discussion of how teddy bears are mass-produced to meet demand and the existence of handmade versions, emphasizing the commercial and cultural impact of the toy.
5. **Economic Significance**: The passage mentions the large profits generated by teddy bears and how they are prominently found in toy stores, underlining their economic relevance.
Now, reviewing the options:
- **A. History of the Teddy Bear.**: While the passage does cover the historical origins and development of the Teddy Bear,
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. A popular toy -- Teddy Bear.

Q: article:             Nowroz: Iranian New Year or Nowroz is celebrated on the first day of spring sometime in March. People sing, dance and parade as in a carnival through the streets with drums and trumpets to spread the news of the coming new year. Rosh Hashanah: The Jewish New Year is called "Rosh Hashanah", and is celebrated in the month of September. It is a holy   time when people think of the things they have done wrong in the past, and promise to do better in the future. Special prayers are held, and an instrument called a Shofar is played. Children are given new clothes, and New Year loaves are baked and fruits are served to remind people of harvest time. Shogatsu: In Japan, the New Year (Shogatsu) celebrations are from January 1 to January 3 and most Japanese don't work during these days. In Japan, the New Year is a fresh start. This means that in December all duties should be completed. Parties are held to forget the worries and troubles of the old year. Homes and cars are decorated. On New Year's Eve, most people spend their time with their families. Bahai New Year: The Bahai people have their own calendar consisting of nineteen months of nineteen days plus a couple of extra days between the eighteenth and nineteenth months. They have, however, adopted the Iranian custom of beginning the New Year in the spring equinox  . The New Year celebrations are held on the evening of March 20th.             question:             During the Jewish New Year,  _  .             options:             ["A. people don't mention things they have done wrong", 'B. children often wear new clothes', 'C. loaves and fruits are often not allowed to be served', 'D. Shofar is their favourite food']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct statement about the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, let's analyze the information provided in the article:
1. **Reflection and Resolution**:
   - The article mentions that during Rosh Hashanah, individuals reflect on their past wrongdoings and make resolutions to improve in the future. This directly contradicts option A, which suggests people don't mention things they have done wrong. Thus, option A is incorrect.
2. **Children's Attire**:
   - It states that children are given new clothes during Rosh Hashanah. This aligns directly with option B, which mentions that children often wear new clothes. Therefore, option B is a plausible answer.
3. **Food and Traditions**:
   - The article specifies that New Year loaves are baked, and fruits are served during Rosh Hashanah, symbolizing the harvest time. This information conflicts with option C, which claims that loaves and fruits are not allowed to be served. Hence, option C is incorrect.
4. **Shofar**:
   - The Shofar is an instrument used during the Jewish New Year, not a type of food. This makes option D inaccurate, as it refers to the Shofar as their favorite food.
Given this analysis
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

Nowroz and Shogatsu.', 'B. Rosh Hashanah and Shogatsu.', 'C. Nowroz and Rosh Hashanah.', 'D. Nowroz and the Bahai New Year.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which festivals are celebrated in the same month, we need to look at the specific timing for each festival:
1. **Nowroz**: This is celebrated on the first day of spring, which is in March.
2. **Rosh Hashanah**: This Jewish New Year is celebrated in September.
3. **Shogatsu**: The Japanese New Year is celebrated from January 1 to January 3.
4. **Bahai New Year**: This is celebrated on the evening of March 20th.
Now, let's compare:
- **Option A**: Nowroz (March) and Shogatsu (January) - These do not match.
- **Option B**: Rosh Hashanah (September) and Shogatsu (January) - These do not match.
- **Option C**: Nowroz (March) and Rosh Hashanah (September) - These do not match.
- **Option D**: Nowroz (March) and the Bahai New Year (March) - Both are celebrated in March.
The correct answer is **Option D: Nowroz and the Bahai New Year** are celebrated in the same month, March.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is **D**.

Q: article:             Every autumn, as families across the United States get ready to send their kids to college, the economics of higher education receive renewed attention. College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it? Several studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families. First, it appears that only the minority actually pay the "high price". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs. Other factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants  to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. At the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges "subsidize  " their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities. This puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more. Therefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price "college in the end.             question:             In the writer's opinion, for students from lower-income families, the best way is   _  .             options:             ['A. to find a good job and make money', 'B. to borrow money from the banks', 'C. to ask for grants', 'D. to borrow money from friends']
A: Let's think step by step.
The article discusses the economics of higher education in the United States, with a focus on the costs and options available to students and their families. It is mentioned that college is expensive, but not everyone pays the full price because many students receive financial assistance in the form of scholarships, loans, or jobs. Importantly, the article highlights that there has been an increase in government grants specifically for lower-income students. These grants are beneficial because, unlike loans, they do not need to be repaid.
The question asks for the best option for students from lower-income families, according to the writer. By analyzing the article, we can see that grants are emphasized as a favorable option since they provide financial aid without the requirement of repayment. This makes them an attractive choice for students who may not have the means to repay loans or other forms of financial aid.
Considering the options provided:
- Option A (to find a good job and make money) and Option D (to borrow money from friends) are not mentioned or emphasized in the article as primary strategies for managing college costs.
- Option B (to borrow money from the banks) involves loans, which must be repaid, and while common, they're not presented as the optimal solution for lower-income families in the article.
- Option C (

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question about what can be inferred from the article, we need to analyze the information provided and consider the given options.
1. **Understanding the Article:**
   - The article discusses the high cost of college education in the United States and how it affects families.
   - It mentions that not all students pay the full price due to financial aid like scholarships, loans, and grants.
   - It states that colleges often spend more on education than the tuition they collect, indicating a subsidization of costs.
   - The article also discusses how competition among colleges for reputation and facilities can drive up costs, and that families will continue to apply to expensive colleges.
2. **Analyzing the Options:**
   - **A. Famous colleges only accept rich students.** 
     - The article doesn't support this. It actually mentions financial aid options which help students from less wealthy backgrounds.
   
   - **B. Famous colleges charge their students more money.**
     - The article suggests that colleges compete for fame by improving facilities and reputation, which may lead to higher costs, implying that famous colleges might charge more. This aligns with the inference that families choose these institutions despite costs.

     - The article

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the writer's opinion, we need to look at the overall message and emphasis of the article.
1. The article discusses the economics of higher education in the U.S., focusing on the rising costs and how students and their families afford it.
2. The article highlights that not all students pay high fees due to scholarships, loans, jobs, and government grants for lower-income students.
3. It mentions that colleges often spend more on education than they collect in fees, effectively subsidizing students.
4. Despite these factors that can alleviate costs, there's a suggestion that educational costs may be higher than necessary due to competition among colleges for prestige.
5. The writer notes that the pressure to gain fame and attract students is a factor in rising costs, which are likely to continue as families are still willing to send their children to high-priced colleges.
Based on the analysis, the article's focus isn't specifically on poor families' struggles or borrowing money (ruling out options A and B). It doesn't suggest that poor families should avoid college for their children (ruling out option C). Instead, the article implies that the increasing costs may be unnecessary and are driven by colleges' desires to improve their status or facilities, but it does not directly advocate for colleges getting more money (which rules
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A. College fees rise too fast for poor families.

Q: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,"Things aren't always what they seem."     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, "How could this happen?" "Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house," she accused  . "The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help." "Things aren't always what they seem," the angel replied. "When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem."             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             ["A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story:
- The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it.
- The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, "Things aren't always what they seem."
- Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune.
With this context in mind, let's examine the options:
- **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.**  
  While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner.
- **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.**  
  There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner.
- **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.**  
  This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole.
- **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is **A**, because she didn't like the greedy owner.

The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, "How could this happen?" "Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house," she accused  . "The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help." "Things aren't always what they seem," the angel replied. "When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem."             question:             The younger angel was very angry because   _  .             options:             ["A. the older angel killed the farmer's cow", 'B. the older angel treated the two families unfairly', 'C. the wealthy man gave them a bad place to live in', 'D. the angel of death took the cow away']
A: Let's think step by step.
The younger angel was upset because of the events that transpired during their stay with the two different families. They had experienced very different treatment from each family, and the results seemed unfair to her.
1. At the wealthy family's house, they were treated poorly, yet the older angel repaired the wall containing hidden gold. The younger angel did not understand why they would help someone who was unkind and greedy.
2. At the poor farmer's house, they were treated with kindness and generosity, yet their only cow ended up dead. The younger angel felt this was unjust, as the family that had little but shared everything they had seemed to be punished rather than rewarded.
Given these points, the key reason for the younger angel's anger was the perceived unfairness in the way the two families were treated by the older angel. The younger angel didn't see the justice in helping the wealthy man while the poor farmer suffered a loss. 
The most fitting option based on this reasoning is:
'B. the older angel treated the two families unfairly'
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B

Q: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,"Things aren't always what they seem."     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, "How could this happen?" "Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house," she accused  . "The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help." "Things aren't always what they seem," the angel replied. "When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem."             question:             Why did the older angel let the farmer's cow die?             options:             ['A. Because God wanted the older angel to take the cow.', 'B. Because she wanted to teach the younger angel a lesson.', "C. Because she wanted to save the farmer's wife.", 'D. Because she was sympathetic to the rich.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The story involves two angels who visit two different households with contrasting characteristics - one wealthy and rude, and the other poor but hospitable. The outcomes in each household provide moral lessons, especially for the younger angel.
1. **First Household (Wealthy Family):** The older angel repairs a hole in the basement wall, which hides gold. She does this because the wealthy family is greedy and she wants to prevent them from finding the gold. She says, "Things aren't always what they seem."
2. **Second Household (Poor Farmer and His Wife):** The farmer and his wife are very hospitable and share what little they have. Unfortunately, their cow dies the next morning, which saddens them greatly as it is their only source of income. The younger angel is upset and questions the fairness of this misfortune.
3. **Older Angel's Explanation:** The older angel reveals that when they were in the poor couple's home, the angel of death came for the farmer's wife. Instead of losing the wife, the older angel asked God if the angel of death could take the cow instead. 
4. **Moral Understanding:** The older angel justifies her actions by indicating that the loss of the cow was to spare the life of the farmer's wife,
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. Because she wanted to save the farmer's wife.

Q: article:             Doris Lessing was born in 1919 in Persia, moving as a child with her family to southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she stayed in school only to the age of 14. A year after moving to London, she published her first novel in 1950.The Grass is Singingexamines unbridgeable racial conflict  in colonial Africa through the eyes of a white farmer's wife and her black servant. Her literary breakthrough came in 1962 with publication ofThe Golden Notebook, seen by many, though not necessarily Lessing, as a pioneering work of modern feminism . A separated study of the mind of the main character, Amma Wulf, the novel explores her thoughts about Africa, politics and relationships with men and sex. Lessing's themes changed to psychology in her works from the 1960s, and by the 1970s the was extremely interested in the Islamic mystic tradition of Sufism . Her turn toward science fiction with theCanopusseries in the early 1980s was not warmly received by traditionalist critics, but she has continued to win new readers and numerous literary awards, including the David Cohen British Literary Prize and the Companion of Honour from the Royal Society of Literature, both in 2001. Following the announcement, the Horace Engdahl told VOA why he was personally so pleased with Lessing's selection. "She is one of the truly great writers-of novels, short stories, fiction and non-fiction," Engdahl said. "She is one of the few writers who have had the courage to uphold the principle of equality between the male and female experience, and she has given the impulse  to numbers of other women writers.

Doris Lessing writes \nThe Golden Notebook', 'B. Doris Lessing is a pioneer of modern feminism', 'C. Doris Lessing wins the Nobel Prize for Literature', 'D. Doris Lessing is concerned about Africa']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage provides a comprehensive overview of Doris Lessing's life, her works, literary themes, and achievements. It highlights her early life experiences, her evolution as a writer, and her significant contributions to literature. The passage mentions several of her works, including "The Grass is Singing" and "The Golden Notebook," and discusses her literary themes such as racial conflict, feminism, psychology, and science fiction.
Here is a closer look at the options provided:
- **Option A: "Doris Lessing writes The Golden Notebook"**
  - While the passage does mention "The Golden Notebook" as a significant work in her career, this title does not encapsulate the overall focus of the passage, which is on Lessing's entire literary career and achievements, not just this single work.
- **Option B: "Doris Lessing is a pioneer of modern feminism"**
  - The passage discusses "The Golden Notebook" and acknowledges its role in modern feminism, but again, the passage covers more than just her feminist themes, including her ventures into psychology, Sufism, and science fiction.

Doris Lessing is strongly against traditional culture in Africa']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, let's go through each option and see which one is best supported by the article:
A. "there are only two characters in The Grass is Singing":
   - The passage mentions the novel "The Grass is Singing" examines racial conflict through the eyes of a white farmer's wife and her black servant. It doesn't state that these are the only characters in the novel. Therefore, this option cannot be accurately inferred.
B. "The Golden Notebook is regarded as Lessing's masterpiece by herself":
   - The passage states that "many, though not necessarily Lessing," see "The Golden Notebook" as a pioneering work of modern feminism. This implies that Lessing herself may not see it as a masterpiece. Therefore, this option is not correct.
C. "life in Africa in her early age lays a solid foundation for her writing":
   - The passage mentions that Doris Lessing was born in Persia and moved to southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she spent her early years. It also relates that she published a novel focusing on racial conflict in colonial Africa and explores themes related to Africa in "The Golden Notebook". These pieces of information suggest that her early life in Africa influenced her writing. Therefore, this option can be inferred from the passage.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Doris Lessing was awarded the Nobel Prize according to Horace Engdahl, let's break down the information provided:
1. Horace Engdahl, speaking about Lessing, stated that "she is one of the truly great writers" across multiple genres such as novels, short stories, fiction, and non-fiction.
2. Engdahl highlights that Lessing is notable for her courage in upholding the principle of equality between male and female experiences.
3. He also mentions that she has inspired numerous other women writers, which suggests her contribution to the literary world extends beyond her own writing.
4. He refers to her as "the mother of a school that is one of the most important in our contemporary literature," implying a legacy of influence on current literature, particularly concerning equal rights for women.
Considering these points, the central reason given by Engdahl for Lessing's Nobel Prize win is her contribution to advancing the principle of equality between male and female experiences and inspiring other women writers.
Thus, option 'D. she makes great contributions to equal rights for women' is the best fit based on Engdahl's comments.

Q: article:             Different exercise types have different purposes and different benefits. One type of exercise may not accomplish all goals of being physically fit: a healthy heart, strong muscles and bones, and safety from injury. As a result, it is important to do enough types of exercise to have all the physical benefits. Here is a quick check sheet. Aerobic Exercise: To have a strong and healthy heart, you need to do aerobic exercise. This means that you need to exercise yourself enough so that your heart rate, while exercising, is 65 percent to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. If you don't get your heart rate up within this level--you just aren't working hard enough. Whatever you do, your heart rate needs to be 65 percent to 85 percent of your MHR for 20 to 30 minutes, at least 3 times a week. Typical types include: * Running * Walking (at least 4 to 4.5 mph) * Swimming * Bikingk3s5u * Elliptical Training   * Yoga Strength Training: To keep your muscles and bones strong, you need to do strength training. This comes in a variety of forms. Whatever you do, however, you need to train your muscles enough so that they are really tired by the end of each _ . To see real benefits, make sure you are strength training 2 to 3 times a week for about 30 to 40 minutes. Typical types of strength training include: * Weight Training * Yoga * Resistance Training * Plyometrics  Flexibility Training: To keep your body flexible, reducing risk of injuries and pain in your joints and muscles, you need to do flexibility training. You should always aim to stretch every muscle after any exercise routine. Typical types of flexibility training include: * Stretching * Yoga * Pilates  So next time you think that yoga 5 times a week will be enough, think about what it is really doing. Is it getting your heart rate up? Are you making up your strength? Are you keeping your muscles flexible?             question:             If your purpose is to   _  , you can choose swimming as your exercise form.             options:             ['A. build a strong and healthy heart', 'B. keep muscles and bones strong', 'C. keep body flexible', 'D. reduce risk of injuries and pain in joints and muscles']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze what swimming primarily offers according to the provided article.
1. **Aerobic Exercise:** The article states that to have a strong and healthy heart, you should engage in aerobic exercise. Examples of aerobic exercises include running, walking, swimming, biking, elliptical training, and yoga. So, swimming is listed as an activity that can help build a strong and healthy heart.
2. **Strength Training:** The article mentions strength training for building strong muscles and bones, with typical types including weight training, yoga, resistance training, and plyometrics. Swimming is not specifically mentioned under strength training.
3. **Flexibility Training:** This section emphasizes stretching and yoga for flexibility, alongside Pilates. Although swimming does improve flexibility, it is not highlighted in this section.
4. **Reducing Injury Risk:** This aspect also falls under flexibility training, which emphasizes stretching, yoga, and Pilates to reduce injury risks. Again, swimming is not specifically mentioned here.
Therefore, based on the information provided, swimming is specifically categorized under aerobic exercises, which are recommended for building a strong and healthy heart.
Conclusively, the best choice is:
**A. build a strong and healthy heart**

The three kinds of training have links with one another']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the content of the passage and each of the options provided:
1. **Option A: Yoga is really better for people than running.**
   - The passage does not specifically state that yoga is better than running. It mentions that different types of exercises have different purposes and benefits, and yoga is included as a form of flexibility and strength training. Running is identified as a form of aerobic exercise.
   - This option is not explicitly supported by the passage.
2. **Option B: The more exercise you do, the better.**
   - While the passage emphasizes the importance of incorporating various forms of exercise for comprehensive physical fitness, it does not imply that more exercise is inherently better. Instead, it highlights balanced exercise routines targeting different areas, like aerobic, strength, and flexibility, rather than simply increasing exercise volume.
   - This option does not accurately reflect the passage's message.
3. **Option C: Flexibility training helps you build up your muscles.**
   - According to the passage, flexibility training is primarily intended to keep the body flexible and reduce the risk of injuries and pain in joints and muscles. It doesn't mention muscle building as a goal of flexibility training, as that falls under strength training.
   - This option misinterpre

Q: article:             "Beating is a sign of affection, cursing  is a sign of love." Many may not expect to hear the words of the old Chinese saying in these modern Times-- with parents wealthier and better educated than they have ever been--but experts say they still ring true. Today,it seems,Chinese parents are more likely to send their children to precollege military academies in the United States in the hope that some tough love will pave the way to success. "Good education doesn't mean letting your children enjoy privileges, especially our boys." said Song Wenming,an entrepreneur  in Jinhua,East China's Zhejiang province. "They should be raised in tough conditions to know what to fight for in the future." In August,Song sent his 17yearold son to Valley Forge Military Academy (VFMA) in Pennsylvania. _ . Statistics show that an increasing number of Chinese students have been registering with such academies. A few years ago, there were no Chinese students at Valley Forge. Today,there are 28."All of the Chinese students at Valley Forge came from wealthy families;some of them were spoiled." said Jennifer Myers, director of marketing and communications at the school. Song's only son, Song Siyu, had a rocky start during his first six weeks at the school. The teenager said he went to the school voluntarily but did not expect it to be as difficult. Now, three months later, he has perfected the art of taking a bath in 35 seconds, finishing a meal without looking at his food, and making his bed with precision. He can even take criticism,no matter how unreasonable. "The training is hard but I know it is good for selfdevelopment of individuals." said SongSiyu. "The endless training and scolding are just ways to build up our character;they are not personal." But his enthusiasm is not universal. Ten of the 13 Chinese students who joined the academy this year have transferred to other schools. But for those who stick to it, there is a reward for all the hard work.             question:             How many Chinese students are there at Valley Forge before this year?             options:             ['A. 10.', 'B. 13.', 'C. 15.', 'D. 25.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The article mentions a few pieces of information regarding the Chinese students at Valley Forge Military Academy (VFMA). First, it states that "A few years ago, there were no Chinese students at Valley Forge." This indicates that before the rise in numbers of Chinese students, there were none at the academy. 
The article then mentions the presence of 28 Chinese students at the academy currently, with 13 having joined this year. However, on calculating using the information given, to find how many were there the previous year (before this increase), we look specifically for the statement that a few years ago there were no Chinese students, which suggests a recent increase.
Hence, before this year, there were indeed no Chinese students at Valley Forge, which matches with the information given about the initial presence of no students. Thus, the number we are looking for is zero, but since the options provided may need us to choose the closest alternative, none of the provided options accurately depict this.
In terms of the options provided, none match the 'zero' notion from "there were no Chinese students at Valley Forge" previously. 
Thus, the number of Chinese students before this year was effectively zero, given the descriptions.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is none of the provided options accurately represent zero, which is the correct answer based on the information. Therefore, none of the options 'A. 10.', '

Q: article:             Some 30,000 years ago, artists who lived in caves in Europe painted pictures of the animals around them: panthers, hyenas, rhinos, cave lions, mammoths and other creatures which have been extinct for a long time. The paintings were highly realistic. Some even showed movement. The artwork, more than a thousand drawings, is considered the oldest group of human cave drawings which have ever been discovered. They were preserved because the cave was sealed---closed off--for more or less 23,000 years. Fast forward to December 18, 1994, a group of French cave scientists were exploring caves in southern France. Jean Marie Chauvet, who led the group then, describes the process of discovering the cave paintings. "At that time I was in the front, Eliette just walked behind me, Christian behind. Eliette said she saw two marks with red ochre and she said, 'They came here.' And at this very moment everything began. The drawings and everything linked to the parietal art . That is where it is tarted." Cave art expert Jean Clotttes reviewed the paintings. "I was amazed at the number of paintings there were and paintings of their quality and particularly in front of the panel of the horses." Scientific analysis confirmed the prehistoric date of the artwork. Studies showed the drawings were created tens of thousands of years ago, before human history was written. The United Nations' cultural agency UNESCO lists the cave as a World Heritage Site. They say that the drawings form a remarkable expression of early human artistic creation of grand excellence and variety. The Chauvet Cave has been named after the explorer who first entered it. However, its environment and drawings are too fragile to be visited by human beings. So the cave is closed, and only people there for scientific purposes can go inside and see the artwork. However, French authorities asked experts to create an exact copy of the cave, called Pont d'Arc Cavern. The copy, which we also called replica, cost more than 59 million dollars to build. It opened at the end of April in France. Pascal Terrasse is the president of the cavern. He says everyone will be able to experience the thrill of looking at drawings made by the first humans in Europe. He says the place is magic because it is done so well. Authorities say they think as many as 400,000 people will be allowed to visit Pont d'Arc Cavern every year.             question:             Which of the follow statements is TRUE about the Chauvet Cave?             options:             ['A. It was closed off for more than 30,000 years.', 'B. It is thought to be the origin of modern parietal art.', 'C. The environment and artwork there are very easy to damage.', 'D. The majority of drawings there are about the extinct animals.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true about the Chauvet Cave, let's evaluate each option:
**Option A: "It was closed off for more than 30,000 years."**
The article mentions that the cave was sealed for about 23,000 years, not 30,000 years. So this statement is not true.
**Option B: "It is thought to be the origin of modern parietal art."**
The article does not mention that Chauvet Cave is considered the origin of modern parietal art. It only states that the discovery of the drawings marked a beginning for understanding more about parietal art. Without further supporting information, we can't conclude this statement is true.
**Option C: "The environment and artwork there are very easy to damage."**
The article states that the environment and drawings in Chauvet Cave are "too fragile to be visited by human beings." This implies that they are indeed very easy to damage. Thus, this statement is true.
**Option D: "The majority of drawings there are about the extinct animals."**
While the article mentions that there are drawings of extinct animals like panthers, hyenas, rhinos, etc., it does not specify that the majority of the drawings are about extinct animals, so we can't
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. The environment and artwork there are very easy to damage.

Q: article:             Some 30,000 years ago, artists who lived in caves in Europe painted pictures of the animals around them: panthers, hyenas, rhinos, cave lions, mammoths and other creatures which have been extinct for a long time. The paintings were highly realistic. Some even showed movement. The artwork, more than a thousand drawings, is considered the oldest group of human cave drawings which have ever been discovered. They were preserved because the cave was sealed---closed off--for more or less 23,000 years. Fast forward to December 18, 1994, a group of French cave scientists were exploring caves in southern France. Jean Marie Chauvet, who led the group then, describes the process of discovering the cave paintings. "At that time I was in the front, Eliette just walked behind me, Christian behind. Eliette said she saw two marks with red ochre and she said, 'They came here.' And at this very moment everything began. The drawings and everything linked to the parietal art . That is where it is tarted." Cave art expert Jean Clotttes reviewed the paintings. "I was amazed at the number of paintings there were and paintings of their quality and particularly in front of the panel of the horses." Scientific analysis confirmed the prehistoric date of the artwork. Studies showed the drawings were created tens of thousands of years ago, before human history was written. The United Nations' cultural agency UNESCO lists the cave as a World Heritage Site. They say that the drawings form a remarkable expression of early human artistic creation of grand excellence and variety. The Chauvet Cave has been named after the explorer who first entered it. However, its environment and drawings are too fragile to be visited by human beings. So the cave is closed, and only people there for scientific purposes can go inside and see the artwork. However, French authorities asked experts to create an exact copy of the cave, called Pont d'Arc Cavern. The copy, which we also called replica, cost more than 59 million dollars to build. It opened at the end of April in France. Pascal Terrasse is the president of the cavern. He says everyone will be able to experience the thrill of looking at drawings made by the first humans in Europe. He says the place is magic because it is done so well. Authorities say they think as many as 400,000 people will be allowed to visit Pont d'Arc Cavern every year.             question:             The purpose of creating Pndt d'Arc Cavern is to  _  .             options:             ['A. show admiration for the earliest artists in Europe', "B. arouse visitors' awareness of protecting ancient art", 'C. offer visitors chances to view the wonderful artwork', 'D. collect money for the perseverance of the Chauvet Cave']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the purpose of creating the Pont d'Arc Cavern, we need to focus on the relevant details provided in the article. 
1. The Chauvet Cave contains prehistoric artwork that is highly valued for its quality and age. These artworks are considered a remarkable expression of early human artistic creation. 
2. The cave itself is too fragile to be visited by the general public. To protect the original site and artworks within it, entry is restricted to people involved in scientific research.
3. Due to the restriction, French authorities commissioned the creation of an exact copy of the cave, known as the Pont d'Arc Cavern. The replica was created so that the public can have the experience of viewing the ancient artwork.
4. Pascal Terrasse, the president of the cavern, mentions that the public will be able to experience the thrill of looking at drawings made by the earliest humans in Europe. He emphasizes the "magic" of the experience, implying that the intent is for visitors to appreciate the art.
Considering these points, the purpose of creating Pont d'Arc Cavern is to offer visitors the chance to view and appreciate the wonderful artwork, which corresponds with the listed option: 
C. offer visitors chances to view the wonderful artwork.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C

Q: article:             About 21,000 young people in 17 American states do not attend classes in school buildings. Instead, they receive their elementary and high school education by working at home on computers.The Center for Education Reform says the United States has 67 public "cyberschools."and that is about twice as many as two years ago. The money for students to attend a cyberschool comes from the governments of the states where they live. Some educators say cyberschools receive money that should support traditional public schools. They also say it is difficult to know if students are learning well. Other educators praise this new form of education for letting students work at their own speed. These people say cyberschools help students who were unhappy or unsuccessful in traditional schools. They say learning at home by computer ends long bus rides for children who live far from school. Whatever the judgement of cyberschools,they are getting more and more popular. For example, a new cyberschool called Commonwealth Connections Academy will take in students this fall. It will serve children in the state of Pennsylvania from ages five through thirteen. Children get free equipment for their online education. This includes a computer,a printer,books and technical services. Parents and students talk with teachers by telephone or by sending emails through their computers when necessary. Students at cyberschools usually do not know one another. But 56 such students who finished studies at Western Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School recently met for the first time. They were guests of honor at their graduation.             question:             What do we know from the text about students of a cyberschool?             options:             ['A. They have to take long bus rides to school.', 'B. They study at home rather than in classrooms.', 'C. They receive money from traditional public schools.', 'D. They do well in traditional school programs.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option in light of information from the text:
A. **They have to take long bus rides to school.**
   - The text actually states that learning at home by computer "ends long bus rides for children who live far from school." So, this option is incorrect.
B. **They study at home rather than in classrooms.**
   - The text mentions that students in cyberschools "do not attend classes in school buildings" and instead "receive their elementary and high school education by working at home on computers." This option correctly reflects this information.
C. **They receive money from traditional public schools.**
   - The text states that cyberschools receive funding from the governments of the states where the students live, not from traditional public schools. Hence, this option is incorrect.
D. **They do well in traditional school programs.**
   - The text does not make any claim about how students perform in traditional school programs. It does mention that cyberschools can help students who were unhappy or unsuccessful in traditional schools, but it does not state they do well in traditional school programs. So, this option is incorrect.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:
B. They study at home rather than in
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B. They study at home rather than in classrooms.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why cyberschools are becoming popular, we will analyze the information provided in the article.
1. **Cyberschools Offer Flexibility**: The article mentions that cyberschools allow students to work at their own speed. This flexibility can help students who may be struggling or feel unhappy in traditional school settings. This is a significant factor in their appeal.
2. **Specialized Support for Students**: Cyberschools can serve students who need a different form of education than that offered by traditional schools. They are particularly beneficial for students who live far from school and would otherwise face long bus rides.
3. **Technological Access and Resources**: Students attending cyberschool receive free equipment, such as a computer and printer, which makes online education accessible.
4. **New Opportunities**: Cyberschools support unique educational environments, such as the newly mentioned Commonwealth Connections Academy in Pennsylvania, catering to younger children.
The article does not directly suggest that cyberschools are less expensive for students, nor does it indicate that graduates are necessarily more successful in society, or that these schools serve a wider age range than traditional schools.
**Conclusion**: Based on the above points, cyberschools are particularly popular because they allow students to work at their own speed,

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the author's perspective from the given text, we need to consider the way information about cyberschools is presented and any apparent bias or judgment.
1. **Presentation of Information**: The article provides factual information about cyberschools, such as the number of students attending, the growth in the number of cyberschools, and funding details. It also presents both advantages (flexibility, personalized pace, elimination of long bus rides) and criticisms (potential funding issues for traditional schools, difficulty in assessing learning quality).
2. **Balanced Viewpoint**: The author includes positive aspects like helping students who are unhappy or unsuccessful in traditional settings, along with negative aspects such as concerns over funding and learning effectiveness. This balanced inclusion of both pros and cons suggests an objective stance.
3. **Lack of Emotionally Charged Language**: The article is devoid of any language that indicates excitement, doubt, or disappointment. The facts are presented straightforwardly without emotional language.
Given the balanced presentation and the lack of emotional or biased language, the option that best aligns with the author's tone is:
- **A. unprejudiced in his description of cyberschools**
Thus, the author appears to be unbiased in their discussion about cyberschools, presenting both sides of the argument

Q: article:             The worst earthquake in 40 years shook South Asia on Sunday, starting with horrible waves that swept entire villages into the sea. At least 20,000 people in six countries were killed in the disaster, and millions were left homeless. The quake shook deep beneath the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It was felt more than 3000 miles away in East Africa, where heavy tides kept fishermen at home and resorts closed. It was as if the sea had struck the land. Residents of Sri Lanka, a small island country off the coast of India, ran to the hills to find safety from the tsunami. Many took their radios, televisions, and other valuables with them. The disaster hit Sri Lanka hardest. Of its 20million people, 1 million lost their homes, and 10000 died. "The water simply raised itself up and huge waves came ashore," wrote eye-witness Peter Thomas from India. "It was moving very fast. The force broke the glass walls of a restaurant on the beach here and damaged hundreds of boats." In some places, the _ struck with no warning. "The weather was fine with no clouds," wrote an eye-witness in Indonesia. "Suddenly the seawater just hit the city. In some parts the water was up to chest level." A massive effort to help the affected countries is already underway. Leaders from around the world have promised to help, and teams of aid workers and doctors are rushing to the sea. "The United States stands ready to offer all the help to those nations most affected." Said White House spokesman Trent Duffy. Organizations from the Red Cross to the International Monetary Fund have started fund-raising drives to make up the costs of rebuilding.             question:             Which of the following is NOT true when this disaster happened?             options:             ['A. A sudden storm started with thunder and lightning.', 'B. The seawater rose suddenly and flooded the land.', 'C. Huge waves came upon the land, damaging the buildings and boats.', 'D. The sea struck the land, causing heavy losses.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is NOT true, let's examine each option in the context of the information provided in the article about the earthquake and tsunami disaster:
- **A. A sudden storm started with thunder and lightning.**
  - The article describes a seismic event (an earthquake) that led to a tsunami. There is no mention of a storm being involved. The event is described as having been unexpected and sudden but because of tectonic movements, not storm activity.
- **B. The seawater rose suddenly and flooded the land.**
  - This is true according to the article. The tsunami caused the seawater to rise and flood coastal areas, as described by eyewitness accounts of the waves coming ashore and causing damage.
- **C. Huge waves came upon the land, damaging the buildings and boats.**
  - This is also true as per the article. It mentioned that massive waves swept ashore, causing destruction to buildings and boats.
- **D. The sea struck the land, causing heavy losses.**
  - This is consistent with the article's description of the tsunami impacting the land and resulting in significant casualties and destruction.
Based on the information given, option **A** (A sudden storm started with thunder and lightning) is NOT true when this disaster happened

Q: article:             Researchers designing the 'classroom of the future' have found that multi-touch, multi-user desks can improve skills in mathematics. New results from a 3-year project working with over 400 pupils, mostly 8-10 year olds, show that cooperation learning increases both fluency   and flexibility in maths.It also shows that using an interactive 'smart' desk can have Benefits over doing mathematics on paper. Using multi-touch desks in the new classroom, the children were able to work together in new ways to solve problems using inventive solutions.Seeing what your friends are doing, and being able to fully participate in group activities, offers new ways of working in class, the researchers say.The 'Star Trek classroom' could also help learning and teaching in other subjects. Lead researcher, Professor Liz Burd, said: "Our aim was to encourage far higher levels Of active student engagement, where knowledge is obtained by sharing, problem-solving and creating, rather than by passive listening.This classroom enables both active engagement and equal access." "We found our tables encouraged students to cooperate more effectively.We were delighted to observe groups of students improving their understanding of mathematical concepts.Such cooperation just did not happen when students used paper-based approaches." The teacher plays a key role in the classroom and can send tasks to different tables to individuals and groups.The teacher can also send one group's answers on to the next group to work on and add to, or to the board for a class discussion.A live feedback   of the desks goes directly to the teacher who can come quickly to help an individual while allowing the group work to continue. Such a classroom may be some way off being a regular feature of schools across the.World due to the costs in setting it up.However, in just 3 years the project team have noted major improvements in the technology, and a reduction in costs.             question:             What improves students' fluency and flexibility in the new classroom?             options:             ['A. Passive listening.', 'B. Doing maths on papers.', 'C. Cooperation learning.', 'D. Learning other subjects.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what improves students' fluency and flexibility in the new classroom, we need to analyze the key points presented in the article. The passage mentions that cooperation learning is a key factor:
1. The article states, "cooperation learning increases both fluency and flexibility in maths." This directly associates cooperation learning with improved fluency and flexibility.
2. The multi-touch, multi-user desks allow students to work together, which involves cooperation learning, and this environment helps in improving these skills.
Now, let's review each option:
- **A. Passive listening.**: The article contrasts passive listening with active engagement, implying passive listening is not the method they are promoting for improvement.
- **B. Doing maths on papers.**: The article suggests that using interactive desks has benefits over doing maths on paper, implying that paper-based methods are not the focus for improvements in fluency and flexibility.
- **C. Cooperation learning.**: This aligns directly with the article's statement that cooperation learning increases fluency and flexibility.
- **D. Learning other subjects.**: The article mainly discusses mathematics and does not specifically link learning other subjects to improvements in mathematical fluency and flexibility.
Considering these points, the correct answer to the question about what improves students' fluency and flexibility
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

Q: article:             Today just as technology changed the face of industry, farmers have undergone an "agricultural revolution". On the farm of today, machines provide all the power. One of the most important benefits will be the farm computer. A few forward-looking farmers are already using computers to help them run their farms more efficiently. The computers help them keep more accurate records so they can make better decisions on what crops to plant, how much livestock to buy, when to sell their products, and how much profit they can expect. Many computer companies have been developing special computer programs just for farmers. Programs are being written for hog  producers, grain farmers, potato farmers, and dairy farmers. In the future, farmers will be able to purchase computer programs made to their needs. Because of the growing importance of computers on the farm, students at agricultural colleges are required to take computer classes in addition to their normal agricultural courses. There can be no doubt that farmers will rely on computers even more in the future. While the old-time farm depended on horse power, and modern farms depend on machine power, farms of the future will depend on computer power. Another technological advance which is still in the experimental stage is the robot, a real "mechanized hired hand" that will be able to move and, in some ways, think like a human being. Unlike farmers of the present, farmers of the future will find that many day-to-day tasks will be done for them. Scientists are now developing robots that will be able to shear  sheep, drive tractors, and harvest fruit. Even complex jobs will be done by robots. For example, in order to milk their cows, farmers must first drive them into the special barn , then connect them to the milking machines, watch the machines, and disconnect them when they are finished. In the future, this will all be done by robots. In addition, when the milking is completed, the robots will automatically check to make sure that the milk is pure. The complete mobilization of the farm is far in the future, but engineers expect that some robots will be used before long.             question:             Which sentence carries the main idea of the whole passage?             options:             ['A.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the given article:
A. "Farmers in the future will depend totally on computers."
- The article suggests that farmers will rely more on computers in the future, but it does not state that they will depend totally on them. There are mentions of robots and machines as well, so this option is too absolute and not supported by the text.
B. "Both computers and robots have been in use on today's farms."
- The article states that forward-looking farmers are already using computers, but robots are described as still in the experimental stage and not yet commonly used on farms. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the passage.
C. "Farmers mainly use machines on their farms at present."
- The article mentions that "On the farm of today, machines provide all the power." This statement aligns with the article, as it suggests that currently, farmers largely rely on machines.
D. "Farmers can do nothing without the help of computers on today's farms."
- The passage does not support this statement. It describes computers as beneficial and increasingly important, but it does not imply that farmers are unable to function without them.
Based on the analysis, the statement that is true according to the article is:

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to refer to the article and identify what engineers expect about the use of robots on farms in the near future. 
1. The article mentions that robots are still in an experimental stage but provides details about their potential future capabilities. 
2. It describes that scientists are developing robots for tasks such as shearing sheep, driving tractors, harvesting fruit, and even the complex task of milking cows.
3. The article states that "The complete mobilization of the farm is far in the future," indicating that not all tasks will be automated soon.
4. However, the engineers expect "that some robots will be used before long," suggesting that only certain tasks, not all, will be performed by robots in the near future.
Given this information, the correct answer is:
'D. some house work' 
The anticipation is that some specific farm tasks (and possibly related house work due to farm integration) will be done by robots in the near future, not all work or even most of it immediately.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D. some house work'

Q: article:             To what degree can a computer achieve intelligence?The answer to this question may lie in a newly-developed US computer program called Smarter Child and the Internet. If you ran into Smarter Child online, you would be surprised at this kid's huge memory. It can recite many facts. For example, Smarter Child knows every baseball player in every team this season. He knows every word in the dictionary and the weather in every major city areas across the US. However, if you ask Smarter Child other questions, you get strange answers. A question about Smarter Child's age returns, "One year, 11 days, 16 hours, 7 minutes, and 47 seconds!" Asking where he lives gets, "In a clean room in a high-tech building in California." Smarter Child uses the vast information on the World Wide Web as his memory bank. To answer questions about spelling, for instance, Smarter Child goes to American Heritage Dictionary online. For the weather, he visits www.intellicast.com. Some scientists believe that by joining the many systems of the Internet, an artificial  being with the combined knowledge of, say, Albert Einstein, Richard Nixon and Britney Spears could be born. However, if Smarter Child wants to think and learn on his own like the boy-computer David in the movie A. I. Artificial Intelligence, he must solve two problems. The first is that computers find it difficult to read web pages because the files  are sorted in different ways. That's why programmers need to tell Smarter Child where to look for the weather. It would be a much more difficult task to let him find it himself. Another problem is that while Smarter Child can process information more exactly and faster than any human, he lacks common sense--a basic grounding of knowledge that is obvious to any young child.             question:             From the text we can infer that www.intellicast.com is a website_.             options:             ['A. which is specially designed to help Smarter Child', 'B. where we people can find Smarter Child', 'C. where weather forecasts are made', 'D. which is about artificial intelligence']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct inference about the website www.intellicast.com, let's analyze the information provided in the text logically:
1. The article mentions Smarter Child as a computer program that uses the Internet to find answers.
2. Specifically, for weather information, Smarter Child consults www.intellicast.com.
3. The primary function highlighted for this website in the context is related to providing weather information.
4. Among the options provided:
   - Option A describes a website designed to specifically help Smarter Child, but the text indicates that Smarter Child just uses it for weather information like anyone else.
   - Option B suggests it's a site where people can find Smarter Child, which is not mentioned or suggested in the text.
   - Option C states that it is a website where weather forecasts are made, which seems to align with the text's indication of Smarter Child visiting it for weather updates.
   - Option D suggests that the website is about artificial intelligence, which is not indicated by the text.
Therefore, based on the text, the most logical inference is:
C. where weather forecasts are made.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking which option represents the most difficult challenge for Smarter Child. 
1. **Understanding Smarter Child's Abilities**:
   - Smarter Child can access a vast amount of information on the Internet.
   - It can provide factual answers by retrieving data from specific sources online.
2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **Option A**: "tell us how to spell a difficult word" - Smarter Child can look up spellings in online dictionaries like the American Heritage Dictionary. This task aligns with its data retrieval abilities.
   - **Option B**: "tell us how the American government is run" - While this could be complex, Smarter Child can still piece together structured information from reliable sources about governmental structures.
   - **Option C**: "provide us with a famous poem by Shakespeare" - Smarter Child could retrieve this type of textual information from relevant literature databases or collections.
   - **Option D**: "learn the ability to tell right behaviors from wrong ones" - This requires common sense and moral reasoning, which Smarter Child lacks as mentioned in the article.
3. **Conclusion**:
   - Smarter Child is proficient in data retrieval, but it does not have the ability to understand or apply common
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is 'D'. Smarter Child would find it most difficult to learn the ability to tell right behaviors from wrong ones due to its lack of common sense and moral reasoning.

Smarter Child uses the vast information on the World Wide Web as his memory bank. To answer questions about spelling, for instance, Smarter Child goes to American Heritage Dictionary online. For the weather, he visits www.intellicast.com. Some scientists believe that by joining the many systems of the Internet, an artificial  being with the combined knowledge of, say, Albert Einstein, Richard Nixon and Britney Spears could be born. However, if Smarter Child wants to think and learn on his own like the boy-computer David in the movie A. I. Artificial Intelligence, he must solve two problems. The first is that computers find it difficult to read web pages because the files  are sorted in different ways. That's why programmers need to tell Smarter Child where to look for the weather. It would be a much more difficult task to let him find it himself. Another problem is that while Smarter Child can process information more exactly and faster than any human, he lacks common sense--a basic grounding of knowledge that is obvious to any young child.             question:             Which of the following is the best title for the passage?             options:             ['A. A New Web Child', 'B. Smarter Child', 'C. The Future of Internet', 'D. Intelligence Development']
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the best title for the passage, we should break down the main points covered in the text:
1. **Introduction to Smarter Child**: The article introduces Smarter Child, a computer program that can access vast information on the Internet to answer questions. It highlights its capabilities, such as knowing facts about baseball, dictionaries, and weather information.
2. **Capabilities and Limitations**: While Smarter Child can access a vast amount of data, it gives bizarre answers to certain questions. This reveals its limitation in understanding and processing information like a human.
3. **Challenges for Achieving Intelligence**: The passage discusses two significant challenges that prevent Smarter Child from achieving true intelligence akin to a human child. These include difficulties in independently accessing and understanding web information and lacking common sense.
4. **Future Implications**: There is a mention of the potential for creating an artificial being with vast knowledge by integrating Internet systems, albeit with current limitations.
Now, let's analyze the provided options:
- **A. A New Web Child**: This option refers directly to Smarter Child as a digital entity on the web. It aligns closely with the article's introduction and focus on Smarter Child.
- **B. Smarter Child**: This is a straightforward title that
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is B.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option, we must identify what the article suggests causes problems in friendships. The article discusses several points related to the challenges in friendships:
1. **Lack of honesty and openness**: Initially, the article mentions that friendships can be difficult because people aren't as honest and open as they should be, but it does not directly link this to the main cause of problems.
2. **Selfishness**: The article heavily emphasizes that most problems with friendships arise because people tend to be selfish, prioritizing their own needs over their friends' needs. It states, "Most problems with friendships come up because people are just too selfish to care about the things that their friends need."
3. **Other issues that arise**: The article also touches on specific scenarios such as friends getting into relationships or making new friends and subsequently spending less time with or leaving old friends. However, these are described as specific examples of problems that might arise, not the fundamental cause.
Given this information, the article identifies selfishness as the primary reason problems appear in friendships. Therefore, the correct option is:
B. one is selfish

Q: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, "Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore."    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites "will finally be worked out". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. "That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama," he told the Los Angeles Times. "It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence."    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    "When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama," he told London's The Times newspaper. "It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world."             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', "C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']
A: Let's think step by step.
The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that "Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore," suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities.
Let's examine the options:
- Option A: "Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one.
  
- Option B: "Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court.
- Option C: "Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life.
- Option D: "American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a

Obama is not the proper role model for African-Americans']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question about Bill Bank's opinion, let's closely examine the information provided in the article:
1. The article discusses Obama's rise and its effect on African-Americans, particularly as a role model.
2. Bill Bank provides a specific perspective on this matter, stating that young blacks need to find role models in their own communities, rather than looking towards national figures like Martin Luther King or Barack Obama.
3. Bill Bank emphasizes the importance of role models who are "actually the people closest to them."
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A** states: "it's better for young blacks to find role models in those who are close to them." This directly reflects Bill Bank's point about the importance of community-level role models.
- **Option B** mentions: "young blacks should not be so much influenced by Obama." Although this could be inferred, it doesn't specifically capture the key aspect of "finding role models close to them."
- **Option C** suggests: "blacks should find other role models because Obama is far from their reality." This option makes an assertion about Obama, but it slightly deviates from the specific community emphasis.
- **Option D** claims: "Obama is not the proper role model for African-Americans." While this is tangentially
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is A. It's better for young blacks to find role models in those who are close to them.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, we need to consider the key themes and messages conveyed in the article.
1. **Overview and Focus:** The passage discusses Barack Obama’s rise as the first African-American president of the United States and examines what this milestone means for race relations, role models, and multiculturalism, both within the U.S. and globally.
2. **Role Model Theme:** A significant portion of the passage focuses on how Obama’s presidency offers a new role model for African-Americans, particularly when compared to athletes and musicians. This aligns with the sentiment expressed by Darius Turner, suggesting that Obama's influence extends beyond just being the first African-American president; it marks a shift in role models for minority communities.
3. **Optimism for Race Relations:** The passage also highlights the optimism regarding race relations following Obama’s election, backed by poll data showing increased optimism among Americans regarding racial issues.
4. **Challenges for Black Communities:** It mentions the ongoing challenges faced by low-income black communities and questions whether Obama’s presidency will bring significant changes to those issues.
5. **Global Multicultural Impact:** Trevor Phillips’ comments extend the discussion to a global context, emphasizing the importance of Obama’s presidency in terms of multiculturalism on the world stage.

The other three leaders except Obama are from Asian countries.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand Trevor Phillips' statement and determine the huge psychological shift he mentioned, we need to analyze the passage and options carefully.
1. **Contextual Clues**: 
   - Trevor Phillips commented on the composition of leaders at the G8 meeting. 
   - He emphasizes the uniqueness of this composition and its impact on global perspectives regarding race.
2. **Passage Details**:
   - The leaders in question are the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan, and Barack Obama.
   - Trevor highlights the significance of Obama, an African-American, being one of these key global leaders.
3. **Key Point of Psychological Shift**:
   - Phillips notes that this situation—where not only is there an African-American president, but also leaders from China, India, and Japan—is unprecedented on global television screens.
   - Thus, it signifies a shift in racial perceptions and the traditional dominance of white leaders in such international settings.
4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A.** The option mentions support for Obama, which isn't discussed as leading to a psychological shift.
   - **B.** This highlights Obama's race specifically, but misses the broader point of the group composition.
   - **C.** Correctly captures
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C. None of the four leaders is white.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to analyze the given article and determine which option best reflects the writer's thoughts about her grandmother.
1. **Option A: "Make mistakes about the youth."**
   - The grandmother complains that children nowadays are not as well-behaved as they used to be. The writer reflects on this opinion by considering how her grandmother was raised under strict conditions. However, there is no clear indication that the writer thinks the grandmother is making mistakes about her opinion; rather, she is reflecting on the differences in upbringing.
2. **Option B: "Complains too much about her childhood."**
   - The grandmother frequently recounts how children were expected to behave in her days, and she uses photo albums to illustrate her points. The article doesn't explicitly say that the writer thinks her grandmother complains about her own childhood too much. Instead, the grandmother appears to express more nostalgia for past values than dissatisfaction with her childhood.
3. **Option C: "Receive good education at school."**
   - The article states that the grandmother stayed at home during her childhood, while her brothers were sent to school. There is no indication that the writer thinks her grandmother received a good education at school.
4. **Option D: "Led an unhappy life when she
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D**.

The writer reflects on her grandmother's strict upbringing and the dull, lonely life she led at home compared to the writer's own freer childhood. This

A: Let's think step by step.
First, let's consider what the passage tells us about the expectations for children's behavior when Granny was young. 
The passage explicitly mentions that Granny's parents, particularly her father, had a strict demeanor, and it states that children "were expected to be seen and not heard." This expression means that children were to behave quietly and not draw attention to themselves, suggesting they needed to be present but subdued.
Now, let's evaluate the given options:
- **A. to speak to the elders loudly**: This option is incorrect because the passage indicates children were expected not to draw much attention, which directly contradicts speaking loudly.
  
- **B. to learn dancing**: This is not mentioned in the passage at all. There is no indication that dancing was a part of the expectations for children in Granny's time.
  
- **C. to be present quietly**: This option aligns well with the description in the passage that children were expected "to be seen and not heard," implying presence without making noise or being overtly expressive.
  
- **D. to stay still and study and be themselves**: This option partly reflects the expectation to be still or quiet, but it adds elements of "studying" and "being themselves," which are not directly supported by the passage content
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is C.

Granny's life story in he past", "B. Granny's complaints about the children", "C. women's life in different times", 'D. children in the past and at present']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main topic of the passage, let's break down the key elements presented:
1. **Introduction and Granny's Complaints**: The passage starts with the author reflecting on their grandmother's complaints about how children are not as well-behaved as they used to be. This introduces the theme of comparing past and present behavior among children.
2. **Granny's Past**: The grandmother's experiences are detailed, emphasizing how children were expected to behave differently in her time. The passage describes her upbringing, the expectations placed on her, and her lifestyle, including cultural elements like clothing and schooling.
3. **Contrast with the Author's Childhood**: The author contrasts their own childhood, which was freer and included activities like playing football and going to school, with Granny’s, highlighting the differences in experiences and expectations between the past and the present.
4. **Overall Theme**: The overarching theme seems to revolve around a comparison of children's behavior and upbringing in the past (Granny's time) versus the present (the author's experiences).
Considering these points, the passage is not primarily about Granny's life story (Option A), as it contrasts two different times rather than focusing solely on her. While Granny's complaints (Option B) are a significant part of the passage,

Q: article:             A great French writer has said that we should help everyone as much as we can because we often need help ourselves. The small even can help the great. About this, he told the following story. An ant was drinking at a small river and fell in. she tried her best to reach the side, but she couldn't move at all. The poor ant got too tired but was still doing her best when a big bird saw her. With a pity, the bird threw a piece of wood. With it the ant reached the bank again. While she was resting and drying herself in grass she heard a man coming up. He was walking without shoes on his feet and carrying a gun in his hand. As soon as he saw the bird, he wished to kill her, and he would certainly do so, but the ant bit  him in one of his feet and at that moment the bird flew away at once. It was an animal much weaker and smaller than the bird herself that had saved her life.             question:             According to the French writer, we often need help from others, so we should   _   .             options:             ['A. help others as much as we can', 'B. help the people who may be useful to us', 'C. get as much help as we can', 'D. first need to help ourselves']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage discusses the idea that we should help others because at times we may need help ourselves. This is illustrated through the story where a bird helps an ant in distress by throwing a piece of wood to save her from drowning. Later, the ant helps the bird escape from a man who intends to harm it. The central lesson conveyed here is one of mutual assistance and the reciprocation of aid, regardless of size or strength differences.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A**: "help others as much as we can" aligns directly with the main idea of the passage. The French writer suggests that helping others is important because we may need help ourselves in the future, as exemplified in the story.
- **Option B**: "help the people who may be useful to us" contradicts the altruistic message of the passage. The helping acts in the story are not based on utility or future benefit.
- **Option C**: "get as much help as we can" does not align with the message of providing help to others; instead, it focuses on receiving rather than giving.
- **Option D**: "first need to help ourselves" does not focus on the central theme of mutual aid and reciprocity emphasized in the passage.

As soon as he saw the bird, he wished to kill her, and he would certainly do so, but the ant bit  him in one of his feet and at that moment the bird flew away at once. It was an animal much weaker and smaller than the bird herself that had saved her life.             question:             Why could the bird fly away at once?             options:             ['A. Because the bird could fly very fast.', 'B. Because the man hurt his feet himself.', "C. Because the man didn't want to kill her.", 'D. Because the ant bit the man in one of his feet.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The story describes a sequence of events where an ant, initially in danger, is saved by a bird, and then later, the ant helps the bird in return. Here's a breakdown of the relevant part of the story:
1. The ant fell into the river and was saved by the bird offering a piece of wood, allowing the ant to reach the bank.
2. Later, a man approached with a gun, intending to kill the bird.
3. The ant, seeing the danger to the bird, bit the man on his feet.
4. This distraction caused the man to lose focus on the bird, which then had the opportunity to escape.
Based on this sequence, the reason the bird could fly away at once is directly linked to the ant's action. The ant biting the man's foot distracted him, allowing the bird the chance to escape unharmed.
So, the correct option is:
D. Because the ant bit the man in one of his feet.
Therefore, the answer (uppercase alphabetic letter) is D
