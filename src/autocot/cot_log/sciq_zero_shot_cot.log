Q: support:             Without Coriolis Effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north. But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere. The winds blow northwest to southeast or the reverse in the southern hemisphere.             question:             What phenomenon makes global winds blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the northern hemisphere and northwest to southeast or the reverse in the southern hemisphere?             options:             A. muon effect B. centrifugal effect C. coriolis effect D. tropical effect
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, let's first clarify the key concept discussed:
1. **Phenomenon Under Discussion**: The question asks about a phenomenon that affects global wind directions.
2. **Global Wind Patterns Without the Phenomenon**: Initially, global winds would blow in a north-south direction if this phenomenon did not exist.
3. **Impact on Wind Directions**:
   - In the **Northern Hemisphere**, these winds are deflected to blow from the northeast to the southwest, or the reverse.
   - In the **Southern Hemisphere**, the winds are deflected to blow from the northwest to the southeast, or the reverse.
4. **Options Provided**: 
   - A. Muon effect - This is related to particles in physics and not related to wind patterns.
   - B. Centrifugal effect - Refers to the outward force felt by an object moving in a curve, not directly explaining wind patterns.
   - C. Coriolis effect - This is the effect caused by the rotation of the Earth, which deflects winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.
   - D. Tropical effect - This is not a standard term for any specific effect influencing global wind patterns.
5. **Conclusion

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. Coriolis effect

Q: support:             Summary Changes of state are examples of phase changes, or phase transitions. All phase changes are accompanied by changes in the energy of a system. Changes from a more-ordered state to a less-ordered state (such as a liquid to a gas) areendothermic. Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always exothermic. The conversion of a solid to a liquid is called fusion (or melting). The energy required to melt 1 mol of a substance is its enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus). The energy change required to vaporize 1 mol of a substance is the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap). The direct conversion of a solid to a gas is sublimation. The amount of energy needed to sublime 1 mol of a substance is its enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) and is the sum of the enthalpies of fusion and vaporization. Plots of the temperature of a substance versus heat added or versus heating time at a constant rate of heating are calledheating curves. Heating curves relate temperature changes to phase transitions. A superheated liquid, a liquid at a temperature and pressure at which it should be a gas, is not stable. A cooling curve is not exactly the reverse of the heating curve because many liquids do not freeze at the expected temperature. Instead, they form a supercooled liquid, a metastable liquid phase that exists below the normal melting point. Supercooled liquids usually crystallize on standing, or adding a seed crystal of the same or another substance can induce crystallization.             question:             Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always what?             options:             A. reactive B. endothermic C. exothermic D. unbalanced
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the concept of phase changes:
1. **Phase Changes and Energy**:
   - A change from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (e.g., liquid to solid) involves the system losing energy. This is because the particles in the more-ordered state (solid) have less kinetic energy compared to those in the less-ordered state (liquid).
   - Such processes involve the release of energy, often in the form of heat.
2. **Definitions**:
   - **Endothermic**: Processes that absorb energy (heat) from the surroundings.
   - **Exothermic**: Processes that release energy (heat) to the surroundings.
3. **Liquid to Solid**:
   - When a liquid turns into a solid, it releases energy. Therefore, this phase change is exothermic.
Considering these points, the correct answer to the question "Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always what?" is:
C. exothermic

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. exothermic

Q: support:             Ring species Ring species demonstrate a version of allopatric speciation. Imagine populations of the species A. Over the geographic range of A there exist a number of subpopulations. These subpopulations (A1 to A5) and (Aa to Ae) have limited regions of overlap with one another but where they overlap they interbreed successfully. But populations A5 and Ae no longer interbreed successfully – are these populations separate species?  In this case, there is no clear-cut answer, but it is likely that in the link between the various populations will be broken and one or more species may form in the future. Consider the black bear Ursus americanus. Originally distributed across all of North America, its distribution is now much more fragmented. Isolated populations are free to adapt to their own particular environments and migration between populations is limited. Clearly the environment in Florida is different from that in Mexico, Alaska, or Newfoundland. Different environments will favor different adaptations. If, over time, these populations were to come back into contact with one another, they might or might not be able to interbreed successfully - reproductive isolation may occur and one species may become many.             question:             Organisms categorized by what species descriptor demonstrate a version of allopatric speciation and have limited regions of overlap with one another, but where they overlap they interbreed successfully?.             options:             A. fitting species B. surface species C. ring species D. species complex

Q: support:             One way to keep iron from corroding is to keep it painted. The layer of paint prevents the water and oxygen necessary for rust formation from coming into contact with the iron. As long as the paint remains intact, the iron is protected from corrosion. Other strategies include alloying the iron with other metals. For example, stainless steel is mostly iron with a bit of chromium. The chromium tends to collect near the surface, where it forms an oxide layer that protects the iron. Zinc-plated or galvanized iron uses a different strategy. Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron because zinc has a lower reduction potential. Since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is a more active metal. Thus, even if the zinc coating is scratched, the zinc will still oxidize before the iron. This suggests that this approach should work with other active metals. Another important way to protect metal is to make it the cathode in a galvanic cell. This is cathodic protection and can be used for metals other than just iron. For example, the rusting of underground iron storage tanks and pipes can be prevented or greatly reduced by connecting them to a more active metal such as zinc or magnesium (Figure 17.18). This is also used to protect the metal parts in water heaters. The more active metals (lower reduction potential) are called sacrificial anodes because as they get used up as they corrode (oxidize) at the anode. The metal being protected serves as the cathode, and so does not oxidize (corrode). When the anodes are properly monitored and periodically replaced, the useful lifetime of the iron storage tank can be greatly extended.             question:             Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron because zinc has a lower reduction potential. since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is a more what?             options:             A. Trap metal B. usually metal C. much metal D. active metal
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks why zinc is more easily oxidized than iron due to its lower reduction potential and what this characteristic makes zinc. 
Reduction potential is a measure of the tendency of a chemical species to acquire electrons and thereby be reduced. A lower reduction potential means that the species is more likely to lose electrons and be oxidized instead, meaning it is more chemically reactive and thus, more "active" in a chemical sense.
The concept of an "active metal" refers to metals that are more likely to give up electrons and be oxidized because they have lower reduction potentials. Since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is more "active" than iron. 
Therefore, the correct answer is:
D. active metal

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. active metal

Q: support:             Occurrence, Preparation, and Compounds of Boron and Silicon Boron constitutes less than 0.001% by weight of the earth’s crust. In nature, it only occurs in compounds with oxygen. Boron is widely distributed in volcanic regions as boric acid, B(OH)3, and in dry lake regions, including the desert areas of California, as borates and salts of boron oxyacids, such as borax, Na2B4O7⋅10H2O. Elemental boron is chemically inert at room temperature, reacting with only fluorine and oxygen to form boron trifluoride, BF3, and boric oxide, B2O3, respectively. At higher temperatures, boron reacts with all nonmetals, except tellurium and the noble gases, and with nearly all metals; it oxidizes to B2O3 when heated with concentrated nitric or sulfuric acid. Boron does not react with nonoxidizing acids. Many boron compounds react readily with water to give boric acid, B(OH)3 (sometimes written as H3BO3). Reduction of boric oxide with magnesium powder forms boron (95–98.5% pure) as a brown, amorphous powder: B 2 O 3(s) + 3Mg(s) ⟶ 2B(s) + 3MgO(s) An amorphous substance is a material that appears to be a solid, but does not have a long-range order like a true solid. Treatment with hydrochloric acid removes the magnesium oxide. Further purification of the boron begins with conversion of the impure boron into boron trichloride. The next step is to heat a mixture of boron trichloride and hydrogen: 1500 °C.             question:             Boron only occurs naturally in compounds with what element?             options:             A. nitrogen B. carbon C. helium D. oxygen

A. Pulmonary system - This primarily refers to the lungs and the respiratory processes involved in gas exchange, where oxygen enters the body and carbon dioxide is expelled. While it involves exchange surfaces, it doesn't link those surfaces to cells throughout the body.
B. Vascular system - This pertains to the network of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries. It is an integral part of distributing blood and nutrients to cells throughout the body. However, the vascular system is often considered a component of the broader circulatory system.
C. Nervous system - This system is responsible for transmitting signals between different parts of the body. It does not primarily deal with the transport of nutrients or gases directly related to exchange surfaces.
D. Circulatory system - This encompasses both the cardiovascular and vascular systems, including the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The circulatory system is responsible for circulating blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen, nutrients, and removing waste products. It effectively links exchange surfaces, like those in the lungs and digestive tract, to cells throughout the body.
Considering these points, the organ system that links exchange surfaces with cells throughout

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. Circulatory system

Q: support:             All plants have a characteristic life cycle that includes alternation of generations . Plants alternate between haploid and diploid generations. Alternation of generations allows for both asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction with spores produces haploid individuals called gametophytes . Sexual reproduction with gametes and fertilization produces diploid individuals called sporophytes . A typical plant’s life cycle is diagrammed in Figure below .             question:             The plants alternation between haploid and diploud generations allow it to do what?             options:             A. reproduce sexually and autonomously B. reproduce asexually and simultaneously C. reproduce asexually and sexually D. reproduce asexually and biologically
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks about what the alternation between haploid and diploid generations in plants allows them to do. According to the support information provided, the alternation of generations involves both asexual and sexual reproduction. Here’s the breakdown:
1. **Haploid Generation**: This refers to the gametophyte stage of the plant's life cycle. In this stage, the plant reproduces asexually by producing spores.
2. **Diploid Generation**: This refers to the sporophyte stage of the life cycle. In this stage, sexual reproduction occurs where gametes are produced and fertilization takes place.
By alternating between these two generations, plants are able to reproduce both asexually (through spores) and sexually (through gametes and fertilization). 
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. Reproduce sexually and autonomously - This option indicates both modalities, but "autonomously" doesn't accurately capture asexual reproduction.
B. Reproduce asexually and simultaneously - This option is incorrect because "simultaneously" doesn't describe the processes outlined in alternation of generations.
C. Reproduce asexually and sexually - This option correctly describes how alternation of generations enables both types of reproduction.
D. Reproduce asexually and

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of the question, which is asking for the term used to describe the termination of a pregnancy in progress.
A. Contraception - This refers to methods or devices used to prevent pregnancy from occurring in the first place. It does not apply to the termination of an existing pregnancy.
B. Abortion - This term describes the deliberate termination of a pregnancy. It is the intentional ending of a pregnancy before the fetus can live independently outside the mother's womb.
C. Delivery - This refers to the process of giving birth, where a pregnancy comes to an end with the birth of a baby. It is not related to the termination of a pregnancy before full term.
D. Miscarriage - This term refers to the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the fetus can survive outside the womb. While it is a form of pregnancy termination, it is not typically what is meant by the "termination of a pregnancy" in a medical context, which is usually an intentional act.
Given these explanations, the correct answer to the question "What is the termination of a pregnancy in progress called?" is:
B. Abortion.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. abortion.

Q: support:             Cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers is one way to prevent dead zones in bodies of water. Preserving wetlands is also important. Wetlands are habitats such as swamps, marshes, and bogs where the ground is soggy or covered with water much of the year. Wetlands slow down and filter runoff before it reaches bodies of water. Wetlands also provide breeding grounds for many different species of organisms.             question:             Cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers and preserving wetlands are ways to prevent what "unlivable" regions in bodies of water?             options:             A. hostile zones B. inhabitable zones C. fresh zones D. dead zones
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to understand what the passage is saying. The passage mentions two key methods to prevent certain "unlivable" regions in bodies of water:
1. **Cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers**: This is suggested as a way to prevent these unlivable regions. Chemical fertilizers can lead to nutrient pollution, which causes excessive growth of algae. When the algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen in the water, creating low-oxygen areas.
2. **Preserving wetlands**: Wetlands are important because they slow down and filter runoff before it reaches larger bodies of water. By doing so, wetlands help prevent nutrient pollution that can lead to the formation of unlivable regions in bodies of water.
The passage directly mentions "dead zones" as an issue that can be mitigated by these actions. "Dead zones" refer to areas in bodies of water where oxygen levels are so low that most marine life cannot survive, hence the term "unlivable." This matches the concept of the regions described in the passage.
Now, let's review the options provided:
A. hostile zones - This does not specifically match any known term used for low-oxygen areas in bodies of water.
B. inhabitable zones - While "inh

Q: support:             Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand The intrinsic muscles of the hand both originate and insert within it (Figure 11.28). These muscles allow your fingers to also make precise movements for actions, such as typing or writing. These muscles are divided into three groups. The thenar muscles are on the radial aspect of the palm. The hypothenar muscles are on the medial aspect of the palm, and the intermediate muscles are midpalmar. The thenar muscles include the abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis, and the adductor pollicis. These muscles form the thenar eminence, the rounded contour of the base of the thumb, and all act on the thumb. The movements of the thumb play an integral role in most precise movements of the hand. The hypothenar muscles include the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, and the opponens digiti minimi. These muscles form the hypothenar eminence, the rounded contour of the little finger, and as such, they all act on the little finger. Finally, the intermediate muscles act on all the fingers and include the lumbrical, the palmar interossei, and the dorsal interossei.             question:             Which muscles allow your fingers to also make precise movements for actions?             options:             A. fine movement muscles B. paired muscles C. intrinsic muscles D. motoric muscles
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which muscles allow your fingers to make precise movements for actions, we need to refer to the description provided in the text:
1. The question asks specifically about muscles that allow for precise movements of the fingers.
2. According to the text, the intrinsic muscles of the hand originate and insert within the hand and are responsible for allowing the fingers to make precise movements, such as those required for typing or writing.
3. The intrinsic muscles are divided into three groups: the thenar muscles, hypothenar muscles, and intermediate muscles.
4. Each group of intrinsic muscles has specific roles, such as acting on the thumb, little finger, or all fingers.
Based on this information, the correct answer to the question "Which muscles allow your fingers to also make precise movements for actions?" is:
C. intrinsic muscles

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to understand which concept typically involves making observations or performing experiments as described in the given context.
1. **Understanding the context**: The statement mentions "testing a hypothesis" and adds that it "requires making observations or performing experiments." This is the standard scientific process where a hypothesis is proposed and then tested through experiments and observations.
2. **Evaluate the options**:
   - **A. Hypothesis**: A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. It is tested through observations and experiments to determine its validity. This aligns perfectly with the statement.
   - **B. Conclusion**: A conclusion is derived after testing and analyzing results. It does not require observations or experiments to exist but is the result of them.
   - **C. Homeostasis**: This is the process by which a living thing maintains stable internal conditions. While it can be studied through observations, the term itself does not imply the act of testing or experimentation.
   - **D. Variables**: Variables are factors that can change and affect experiments. They are part of experimental design but not what is tested through observations or experiments themselves.
3. **Analysis**: The statement about "testing" aligns clearly with the scientific method of testing a "hypothesis"

Q: support:             any other electron, they become a part of the molecule’s electron system.204 This sharing of electrons produces what is known as a covalent bond. Covalent bonds are ~20 to 50 times stronger than van der Waals interactions. What exactly does that mean? Basically, it takes 20 to 50 times more energy to break a covalent bond compared to a van der Waals interaction. While the bonded form of atoms in a molecule is always more stable than the unbounded form, it may not be stable enough to withstand the energy delivered through collisions with neighboring molecules. Different bonds between different atoms in different molecular contexts differ in terms of bond stability; the bond energy refers the energy needed to break a particular bond. A molecule is stable if the bond energies associated with bonded atoms within the molecule are high enough to survive the energy delivered to the molecule through either collisions with neighboring molecules or the absorption of energy (light). When atoms form a covalent bond, their individual van der Waals surfaces merge to produce a new molecular van der Waals surface. There are a number of ways to draw molecules, but the spacefilling or van der Waals surface view is the most realistic (at least for our purposes). While realistic it can also be confusing, since it obscures the underlying molecular structure, that is, how the atoms in the molecule are linked together. This can be seen in this set of representations of the simple molecule 2methylpropane (→).205 As molecules become larger, as is the case with many biologically important molecules, it can become impossible to appreciate their underlying organization based on a van der Waals surface representation. Because they form a new stable entity, it is not surprising (perhaps) that the properties of a molecule are quite distinct from, although certainly influenced by, the properties of the atoms from which they are composed. To a first order approximation, a molecule’s properties are based on its shape, which is dictated by how the various atoms withjn the molecule are connected to one another. These geometries are imposed by each atom’s underlying quantum mechanical properties and (particularly as molecules get larger, as they so often do in biological systems) the interactions between different parts of the molecule with one another. Some atoms, common to biological systems, such as hydrogen (H), can form only a single covalent bond. Others can make two (oxygen (O) and sulfur (S)), three (nitrogen (N)), four (carbon (C)), or five (phosphorus (P)) bonds. In addition to smaller molecules, biological systems contain a number of distinct types of extremely large molecules, composed of many thousands of atoms; these are known as macromolecules. Such macromolecules are not rigid; they can often fold back on themselves leading to intramolecular interactions. There are also interactions between molecules. The strength and specificity of these interactions can vary dramatically and even small changes in molecular structure (such as caused by mutations and allelic variations) can have dramatic effects.             question:             This sharing of electrons produces what is known as a covalent bond. covalent bonds are ~20 to 50 times stronger than what?             options:             A. gravitational pull B. van der waals interactions C. Mendelian systems D. Newton's third law
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to identify the correct comparison made in the text regarding the strength of covalent bonds. 
1. The text mentions that the sharing of electrons between atoms results in what is called a covalent bond.
2. It is specified that covalent bonds are stronger than another type of interaction.
3. The text clearly states, "Covalent bonds are ~20 to 50 times stronger than van der Waals interactions."
4. Reviewing the options given:
   - A. gravitational pull
   - B. van der Waals interactions
   - C. Mendelian systems
   - D. Newton's third law
Option B, "van der Waals interactions," is the correct answer, as it directly matches the information provided in the text about the strength comparison.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. van der Waals interactions

Q: support:             Water molecules move about continuously due to their kinetic energy. When a crystal of sodium chloride is placed into water, the water’s molecules collide with the crystal lattice. Recall that the crystal lattice is composed of alternating positive and negative ions. Water is attracted to the sodium chloride crystal because water is polar and has both a positive and a negative end. The positively charged sodium ions in the crystal attract the oxygen end of the water molecules because they are partially negative. The negatively charged chloride ions in the crystal attract the hydrogen end of the water molecules because they are partially positive. The action of the polar water molecules takes the crystal lattice apart (see image below).             question:             Water molecules move about continuously due to what type of energy?             options:             A. optical B. kinetic C. potential D. seismic
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify the type of energy that causes water molecules to move continuously.
1. **Understanding the Options:**
   - **Optical Energy (Option A):** Typically related to the electromagnetic spectrum and involves light, which isn't relevant to molecular movement.
   - **Kinetic Energy (Option B):** The energy associated with motion. Molecules moving continuously will have kinetic energy.
   - **Potential Energy (Option C):** The energy stored due to an object's position or arrangement. Does not apply directly to the continuous movement of molecules.
   - **Seismic Energy (Option D):** Related to energy passed through the Earth, such as that from earthquakes. Not applicable to water molecules in a typical setting.
2. **Relating Back to the Passage:**
   - The passage specifically states, "Water molecules move about continuously due to their kinetic energy." This directly indicates that the type of energy in question is kinetic energy.
Given the analysis based on the options and the information in the passage, the correct answer is:
B. kinetic

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which type of map is being referred to, we should analyze the support statement provided:
1. The support statement mentions "geologic maps" as the type of maps that display "rock units and geologic features." 
2. It specifies that a "small scale map" displays "individual rock units," which implies detail and specificity, characteristics of geologic maps.
3. The question is asking for the type of map where a small scale version displays individual rock units.
Now, let's go through the options:
A. Seismic map: This type of map is generally used to show seismic activities and is not specifically about displaying rock units.
B. Geographic map: This map is used for general geographic information, such as political boundaries, roads, or physical landscapes, but not specifically for rock units.
C. Geologic map: This is the type of map referenced in the support statement that displays rock units and geologic features, aligning with the description given.
D. Polar map: Typically used for mapping polar regions, not specifically for rock units.
Given this reasoning, the option C. geologic map is the correct choice. Therefore, the type of map that, in small scale, displays individual rock units is a geologic map.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. geologic map.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to find which option best matches the definition provided in the question: "a change in the inherited traits of organisms over time."
1. **Option A: Generation** - This refers to a single stage in the life cycle of an organism or a group of organisms. It doesn't describe a change in traits over time, just a point in time for the life cycle.
2. **Option B: Variation** - This term refers to the differences in traits among individuals of the same species. While variation is an important part of evolution (since it provides the different traits among individuals), variation itself does not specifically describe the change of these traits over time.
3. **Option C: Divergence** - This term refers to the process by which two or more related species become more different over time. While divergence can occur as a result of evolutionary processes, it does not exclusively define the inherited change over time.
4. **Option D: Evolution** - This is defined as a change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms over time. This matches the definition provided in the question perfectly.
Thus, the best option that defines "a change in the inherited traits of organisms over time" is **Option D: Evolution**.

The main pituitary hormone involved is luteinizing hormone (LH) . It stimulates the testes to secrete testosterone. Testosterone, in turn, promotes protein synthesis and growth. It brings about most of the physical changes of puberty, some of which are shown in Figure below . In addition to the changes shown below, during puberty male facial hair begins to grow, the shoulders broaden, and the male voice deepens. You can watch an animation of these and other changes that occur in boys during puberty at the Interactive Body link: http://www. bbc. co. uk/science/humanbody/body/interactives/lifecycle/teenagers/ .             question:             What hormone, which is associated with luteinizing hormone and male sexuality, helps bring about physical changes in puberty?             options:             A. epinephrine B. estrogen C. steroids D. testosterone
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we start by identifying the hormone in question.
1. **Understanding the Role of Hormones in Puberty**: From the provided content, we know that the hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to secrete hormones that affect the testes.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what photosynthetic protists use to create food, it's important to focus on the process of photosynthesis itself. Photosynthesis is the process by which organisms convert light energy into chemical energy, specifically in the form of glucose, using sunlight. 
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. Thermal energy - While thermal energy relates to heat, it is not the primary energy source for photosynthesis, so this is not correct.
B. Decayed matter - This refers to decomposed organic material, which is not used in photosynthesis, so this option is incorrect.
C. Hydrocarbons - These are organic compounds made of hydrogen and carbon, typically used as fuel sources rather than sources of light energy for photosynthesis, so this is not the correct choice.
D. Light energy - This is indeed the energy source that photosynthetic organisms, including photosynthetic protists, use to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose during photosynthesis. Therefore, this option is correct.
Therefore, the correct answer to what photosynthetic protists use to create food is D. light energy.

Q: support:             Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. They are bipedal, which means they walk on two legs. Birds also lay amniotic eggs, and the eggs have hard, calcium carbonate shells. Although birds are the most recent class of vertebrates to evolve, they are now the most numerous vertebrates on Earth. Why have birds been so successful? What traits allowed them to increase and diversify so rapidly?.             question:             What type of vertebrates are birds?             options:             A. invertebrates B. exothermic C. epidermal tetrapod D. endothermic tetrapod
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct classification of birds among the given options, we need to understand the characteristics described in the support passage.
1. **Classification of Birds**:
   - Birds are classified as vertebrates, meaning they possess a backbone or spinal column.
2. **Body Temperature Regulation**:
   - The passage states that birds are "endothermic." Endothermic organisms regulate their body temperature internally, typically maintaining it at a constant level regardless of external conditions. This is often the term used for "warm-blooded" animals.
3. **Number of Limbs**:
   - The term "tetrapod" indicates that the organism has four limbs. In the case of birds, this includes two legs and two wings.
4. **Walking Ability**:
   - Birds are described as "bipedal," implying they walk on two legs.
5. **Egg Characteristics**:
   - Birds lay "amniotic eggs" with hard, calcium carbonate shells.
Given these characteristics, which align with birds being warm-blooded, having four limbs, and being part of the vertebrate group, we can select the correct option:
- **A. invertebrates**: Incorrect. Invertebrates do not possess a backbone.
- **B. ex

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. endothermic tetrapod

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the basic concept of ionic compounds.
1. **Ionic Compounds**: These are chemical compounds composed of ions held together by electrostatic forces termed ionic bonding.
2. **Types of Ions in Ionic Compounds**:
   - **Positive Ions (Cations)**: These are atoms or molecules that have lost one or more electrons and therefore have a net positive charge.
   - **Negative Ions (Anions)**: These are atoms or molecules that have gained one or more electrons, giving them a net negative charge.
3. **Answering the Question**: The question asks what types of ions ionic compounds contain. We know from the above that ionic compounds contain both positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions).
Therefore, the correct option is:
C. positive and negative

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. positive and negative

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what all living things need to survive in addition to air, let's evaluate each option:
A. Stimuli - While responding to stimuli is important for the survival of many organisms, it is not a basic necessity for life like air or water.
B. Ecosystem - An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their environment, but it is not something living things "need" in the same way they need air or water.
C. Water - Water is essential for all known forms of life. It is a fundamental requirement for survival, alongside air.
D. Habitat - While an appropriate habitat is crucial for survival, it isn't as universally necessary for the physiological processes of life as air and water are.
Among the options, water is the most basic and essential requirement in addition to air for the survival of all living things. Thus, the correct answer is:
C. water

Q: support:             temperatures with electropositive metals such as those of groups 1 and 2 and aluminum produces ionic carbides, which contain discrete metal cations and carbon anions. The identity of the anions depends on the size of the second element. For example, smaller elements such as beryllium and aluminum give methides such as Be2C and Al4C3, which formally contain the C4− ion derived from methane (CH4) by losing all four H atoms as protons. In contrast, larger metals such as sodium and calcium give carbides with stoichiometries of Na2C2 and CaC2. Because these carbides contain the C4− ion, which is derived from acetylene (HC≡CH) by losing both H atoms as protons, they are more properly called acetylides. As discussed in Chapter 21 "Periodic Trends and the ", Section 21.4 "The Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2)", reacting ionic carbides with dilute aqueous acid results in protonation of the anions to give the parent hydrocarbons: CH4 or C2H2. For many years, miners’ lamps used the reaction of calcium carbide with water to produce a steady supply of acetylene, which was ignited to provide a portable lantern. The reaction of carbon with most transition metals at high temperatures produces interstitial carbides. Due to the less electropositive nature of the transition metals, these carbides contain covalent metal– carbon interactions, which result in different properties: most interstitial carbides are good conductors of electricity, have high melting points, and are among the hardest substances known. Interstitial carbides exhibit a variety of nominal compositions, and they are often nonstoichiometric compounds whose carbon content can vary over a wide range. Among the most important are tungsten carbide (WC), which is used industrially in high-speed cutting tools, and cementite (Fe3C), which is a major component of steel. Elements with an electronegativity similar to that of carbon form covalent carbides, such as silicon carbide (SiC; Equation 22.15) and boron carbide (B4C). These substances are extremely hard, have high melting points, and are chemically inert. For example, silicon carbide is highly resistant to chemical attack at temperatures as high as 1600°C. Because it also maintains its strength at high temperatures, silicon carbide is used in heating elements for electric furnaces and in variable-temperature resistors.             question:             Interstitial carbides are produced by the reaction of most transition metals at high temperatures with what element?             options:             A. carbon B. oxygen C. hydrogen D. nitrogen
A: Let's think step by step.
Interstitial carbides are formed through the reaction of most transition metals with another element at high temperatures. From the context provided, interstitial carbides involve covalent metal–carbon interactions, indicating the key element involved in their formation is carbon. Thus, when these metals react with carbon at high temperatures, interstitial carbides result. Hence, considering the options presented:
A. carbon
B. oxygen
C. hydrogen
D. nitrogen
The correct answer is: **A. carbon**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. carbon

Q: support:             Agents of Decomposition The fungus-like protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes. For instance, many types of oomycetes grow on dead animals or algae. Saprobic protists have the essential function of returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water. This process allows for new plant growth, which in turn generates sustenance for other organisms along the food chain. Indeed, without saprobe species, such as protists, fungi, and bacteria, life would cease to exist as all organic carbon became “tied up” in dead organisms.             question:             Fungus-like protist saprobes play what role in a food chain and are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes?             options:             A. aphids B. decomposers C. fluxes D. Soil
A: Let's think step by step.
Fungus-like protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes. This indicates that they break down dead material. The passage states that these saprobes have the essential function of returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water, which allows for new plant growth and sustains other organisms along the food chain.
In the context of a food chain, an organism that breaks down dead material and returns the nutrients to the environment performs the role of a decomposer. Decomposers are crucial because they recycle nutrients and enable other organisms to utilize them. 
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. Aphids - These are insects that feed on plant sap and are not related to decomposing organic matter.
B. Decomposers - This option fits the role described in the passage perfectly, as decomposers break down dead material and recycle nutrients.
C. Fluxes - This term refers to flows or changes and does not specifically describe the role in breaking down organic matter.
D. Soil - This is unrelated to the specific role of breaking down organic matter in the context given.
After considering the options, the correct answer is B. Decomposers.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. Decomposers.

They are made of ribosomal protein and ribosomal RNA, and are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Unlike other organelles, ribosomes are not surrounded by a membrane. Each ribosome has two parts, a large and a small subunit, as shown in Figure below . The subunits are attached to one another. Ribosomes can be found alone or in groups within the cytoplasm. Some ribosomes are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (as shown in Figure below ), and others are attached to the nuclear envelope.             question:             What are the sites of protein synthesis or assembly?             options:             A. chromosomes B. ribosomes C. chloroplasts D. plasma

A. Chromosomes: These are structures within cells that contain DNA. They are not involved in protein synthesis or assembly; instead, they carry genetic information.
B. Ribosomes: These are small organelles that are indeed the sites of protein synthesis or assembly. Ribosomes read mRNA sequences and translate them into amino acid chains, which then fold into functional proteins.
C. Chloroplasts: These are organelles found in plant cells that conduct photosynthesis. They are not involved in protein synthesis.
D. Plasma: This term often refers to the liquid component of blood or cellular plasma membrane. Neither is directly involved in protein synthesis.

Q: support:             Meiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase of the cell cycle. In both meiosis I and meiosis II , cells go through the same four phases as mitosis - prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. However, there are important differences between meiosis I and mitosis. The eight stages of meiosis are summarized below. The stages will be described for a human cell, starting with 46 chromosomes.             question:             What must replicate in the cell cycle before meiosis i takes place?             options:             A. dna B. sperm C. meiotic fluid D. cell walls
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what must replicate in the cell cycle before meiosis I takes place, let's go through the possibilities one by one:
A. DNA: During the cell cycle, DNA must replicate before meiosis can begin. This replication happens during the interphase, specifically during the S phase of interphase. This ensures that the cell has a complete set of chromosomes before dividing.
B. Sperm: Sperm cells are not something that replicates prior to meiosis. Sperm cells are the result of meiosis in male organisms, not a precursor.
C. Meiotic fluid: There is no such thing as meiotic fluid that needs to replicate. Meiosis involves the division of cells and chromosomes, not fluids.
D. Cell walls: In animal cells, which is our context here (for human cells), cell walls do not exist. Even in plant cells, cell walls do not replicate; they are structures that form after cell division.
Considering the above points, the correct answer is:
A. DNA

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question about the phenomenon that is primarily the result of plate tectonic motions, let's consider what typically happens at different types of plate boundaries:
1. **Convergent Boundaries**: These occur where two tectonic plates are moving towards each other. The stress at these boundaries is compressional. When they collide, one plate may be forced underneath another in a process known as subduction, often causing earthquakes.
2. **Divergent Boundaries**: These occur where two tectonic plates are moving away from each other. The stress here is tensional. As the plates separate, magma can rise from the mantle to create new crust, which can also cause earthquakes as it solidifies and shifts.
3. **Transform Boundaries**: These occur where two tectonic plates slide past each other horizontally. The stress here is shear stress. The friction between the sliding plates can cause earthquakes.
Now, considering the options provided:
- A. Eruption: This usually refers to volcanic activity, which is not primarily caused by tectonic plate motions, although it can be related to them (especially at convergent and divergent plate boundaries).
- B. Earthquake: This is a sudden shaking of the ground typically caused by the movements of tectonic plates along the boundaries

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. Earthquake

Q: support:             Ganglia A ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery. Ganglia can be categorized, for the most part, as either sensory ganglia or autonomic ganglia, referring to their primary functions. The most common type of sensory ganglion is a dorsal (posterior) root ganglion. These ganglia are the cell bodies of neurons with axons that are sensory endings in the periphery, such as in the skin, and that extend into the CNS through the dorsal nerve root. The ganglion is an enlargement of the nerve root. Under microscopic inspection, it can be seen to include the cell bodies of the neurons, as well as bundles of fibers that are the posterior nerve root (Figure 13.19). The cells of the dorsal root ganglion are unipolar cells, classifying them by shape. Also, the small round nuclei of satellite cells can be seen surrounding—as if they were orbiting—the neuron cell bodies.             question:             What is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery called?             options:             A. gangism B. ganglion C. organism D. crystals
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify the term used to describe a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery.
1. **Understanding the Context:** The text provided defines a "ganglion" as a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery.
2. **Evaluating the Options:**
   - **A. gangism**: This term is not related to neuron cell bodies in a biological context. 
   - **B. ganglion**: The passage explicitly states that a ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery.
   - **C. organism**: An organism refers to an individual living entity, not specifically to neuron cell bodies.
   - **D. crystals**: Crystals are solid materials with atoms arranged in a highly ordered structure, unrelated to neuron cell bodies.
3. **Conclusion:** Based on the information given, option B, "ganglion," correctly refers to a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery.
Therefore, the answer is B. ganglion.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. ganglion.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where most of our food comes from, we need to understand what each of the options refers to:
A. Gymnosperms: These are a group of seed-producing plants that include conifers such as pine, spruce, and fir trees. They are not the primary source of most human food.
B. Angiosperms: These are flowering plants, and they represent a large group of plants that produce seeds enclosed in fruits. This group includes most of the plants we consume as food, such as grains (wheat, rice, corn), fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts.
C. Microbes: These are microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and algae. While they play critical roles in food production (for example, in fermentation processes like those used to make bread, cheese, yogurt, and beer), they are not the primary source of food themselves.
D. Lichen: These are complex organisms arising from the symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria. They are not a significant source of human food.
Step by step, we see that angiosperms, being the group that includes a wide variety of flowering plants, constitute the majority of plant-based foods we consume. Consequently, the correct answer is:
B. Angiosper

Q: support:             Under what conditions then, do gases behave least ideally? When a gas is put under high pressure, its molecules are forced closer together as the empty space between the particles is diminished. A decrease in the empty space means that the assumption that the volume of the particles themselves is negligible is less valid. When a gas is cooled, the decrease in kinetic energy of the particles causes them to slow down. If the particles are moving at slower speeds, the attractive forces between them are more prominent. Another way to view it is that continued cooling the gas will eventually turn it into a liquid and a liquid is certainly not an ideal gas anymore (see liquid nitrogen in the Figure below ). In summary, a real gas deviates most from an ideal gas at low temperatures and high pressures. Gases are most ideal at high temperature and low pressure.             question:             Gases are most ideal at high temperature and what pressure?             options:             A. high B. stable C. absolute D. low
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when gases behave most ideally, we need to consider the conditions that minimize the interactions and volume of the gas molecules. According to the passage, gases behave least ideally under conditions of high pressure and low temperature. Conversely, this implies that gases are most ideal under conditions that maximize the separation between molecules and reduce their interactions, which is high temperature and low pressure.
- High temperature increases the kinetic energy of the gas molecules, causing them to move more rapidly and decreasing the impact of intermolecular attractions.
- Low pressure reduces the force exerted on gas molecules, allowing them to remain further apart and making the volume of the particles themselves negligible compared to the volume of the container.
Therefore, combining high temperature with low pressure enables gas molecules to adhere closely to the ideal gas assumptions: negligible intermolecular forces and negligible volume of gas particles.
The correct answer is:
D. low

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. low

Water cannot easily penetrate them. Granite is a very stable igneous rock. Other types of rock are easily weathered because they dissolve easily in weak acids. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that dissolves easily. When softer rocks wear away, the more resistant rocks form ridges or hills.             question:             Hard igneous rocks and easily dissolved sedimentary rocks respond very differently to what natural force?             options:             A. sunlight B. gravity C. weathering D. evaporation
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which natural force hard igneous rocks and easily dissolved sedimentary rocks respond to differently, let's analyze the passage:
1. The passage states that each type of rock weathers in its own way and mentions that igneous rocks weather slowly. This indicates a natural force affecting the rocks is weathering.
2. The passage elaborates that hard igneous rocks like granite are resistant to weathering because they are hard and water cannot easily penetrate them.
3. For sedimentary rocks like limestone, the passage mentions they dissolve easily in weak acids, indicating they weather more readily.
4. Based on these points, we see that the passage specifically discusses the process of weathering and its different effects on igneous and sedimentary rocks.
Now, let's look at the options:
- A. Sunlight: Sunlight can cause some weathering, but the passage focuses on water and acids, not sunlight.
- B. Gravity: Gravity influences erosion but is not specifically discussed in the passage in relation to different rock types weathering.
- C. Weathering: The passage is all about weathering and how different rocks respond to it.
- D. Evaporation: Evaporation is not mentioned in the passage as a force affecting rock weathering.

Enzymes allow reactions to occur at the rate necessary for life.             question:             What substances serve as catalysts in most of the biochemical reactions that take place in organisms?             options:             A. enzymes B. iseotrops C. carbohydrates D. hormones
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to identify which substances serve as catalysts in biochemical reactions within organisms.
1. The question asks about substances that are catalysts in biochemical reactions.
2. In the provided text (support), it's stated that enzymes are involved in most biochemical reactions and that they catalyze these reactions.
3. This directly points to enzymes being the substances that serve as catalysts.
Now let's evaluate the options:
A. Enzymes — The support text explicitly mentions enzymes as catalysts, which is consistent with our analysis.
B. Iseotrops — This term is not commonly associated with biochemistry or catalysis in organisms and is likely not related.
C. Carbohydrates — These are organic compounds serving primarily as energy sources and structural components, not typically catalysts.
D. Hormones — These are signaling molecules, not catalysts; they regulate physiological activities.
Based on the information and analysis, the correct answer is:
A. enzymes

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. enzymes

Q: support:             The metals of group 13 (Al, Ga, In, and Tl) are all reactive. However, passivation occurs as a tough, hard, thin film of the metal oxide forms upon exposure to air. Disruption of this film may counter the passivation, allowing the metal to react. One way to disrupt the film is to expose the passivated metal to mercury. Some of the metal dissolves in the mercury to form an amalgam, which sheds the protective oxide layer to expose the metal to further reaction. The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water.             question:             The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with what?             options:             A. cloth and plastic B. helium and oxygen C. blood and sweat D. air and water
A: Let's think step by step.
To find out what the formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with, we should consider the context provided in the support paragraph. The metals of group 13, such as Al, Ga, In, and Tl, are initially passivated by a thin film of metal oxide when exposed to air, which prevents further reaction.
The paragraph then states that exposing the passivated metal to mercury disrupts this protective layer. When the metal dissolves in mercury to form an amalgam, the protective oxide layer is shed. This exposure enables the metal to react further, specifically with components that it otherwise wouldn't be able to due to the oxide layer's passivation.
The final sentence in the paragraph clearly mentions that "The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water." Therefore, it is clear that the amalgam formation leads the metal to react with these specific elements.
Thus, the correct answer is:  
D. air and water

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. air and water

Q: support:             automobile axle drives a wheel, which has a much larger diameter than the axle. The MA is less than 1. (c) An ordinary pulley is used to lift a heavy load. The pulley changes the direction of the force T exerted by the cord without changing its magnitude. Hence, this machine has an MA of 1.             question:             A pulley changes the direction of the force t exerted by the cord without changing its what?             options:             A. position B. longitude C. magnitude D. latitude
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the correct answer, let's break down the information given in the statement:
The statement mentions that "An ordinary pulley is used to lift a heavy load. The pulley changes the direction of the force T exerted by the cord without changing its magnitude."
The question asks: "A pulley changes the direction of the force T exerted by the cord without changing its what?"
The answer lies in the statement itself, which indicates that the pulley does not change the "magnitude" of the force. The magnitude of a force refers to its size or amount in terms of how much force is being exerted.
Now, let's examine the options:
A. position - This refers to the location of the force or object.
B. longitude - This is a geographical term related to the east-west position on Earth, irrelevant in this context.
C. magnitude - This refers to the size or amount of the force, which the statement says is unchanged.
D. latitude - This is another geographical term, related to the north-south position on Earth, and irrelevant here.
Therefore, the correct choice is option C, magnitude. The pulley changes the direction of the force without changing its magnitude.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. magnitude

Q: support:             What if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground? The bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is greater. Would it fall to the ground faster? No, the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time. The reason? The more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass, so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball. This is true of all falling objects. They all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity, unless air resistance affects one object more than another. For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area. You can simulate the effect of air resistance on acceleration due to gravity by doing the interactive animation at this URL: http://www. science-animations. com/support-files/freefall. swf.             question:             In the absence of air resistance, all falling objects accelerate at the same rate due to what force?             options:             A. weight B. motion C. gravity D. velocity
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify the force responsible for the acceleration of falling objects in the absence of air resistance.
1. **Understanding the scenario:** 
   - In the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate. 
   - The rate of acceleration of falling objects is due to a force acting upon them.
2. **Evaluating the options:**
   - A. **Weight:** While weight is the force of gravity acting on an object, it's not the reason all objects fall at the same rate.
   - B. **Motion:** Motion is the state of changing position but is not a force.
   - C. **Gravity:** Gravity is the fundamental force causing objects to accelerate when they fall.
   - D. **Velocity:** Velocity is the speed of an object in a given direction but is not a force.
3. **Applying knowledge of physics:**
   - Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward the Earth, providing the uniform acceleration of all falling objects in the absence of air resistance.
Based on this analysis, the correct option is:
C. gravity

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. gravity

It protects and supports the cell and also controls everything that enters and leaves the cell. It allows only certain substances to pass through, while keeping others in or out. The ability to allow only certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as selective permeability or semipermeability. To understand how the plasma membrane controls what crosses into or out of the cell, you need to know its composition.             question:             The ability for a plasma membrane to only allow certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as what?             options:             A. moderate permeability B. selective permeability C. total permeability D. periodic permeability
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to refer back to the passage provided. The passage mentions that the plasma membrane "allows only certain substances to pass through, while keeping others in or out." This ability is referred to as "selective permeability or semipermeability." 
Now, let's look at the options given:
A. Moderate permeability - This is not mentioned in the passage and does not accurately describe the selective nature.
B. Selective permeability - This matches exactly what the passage states about the ability of the plasma membrane.
C. Total permeability - This would imply that everything can pass through, which contradicts the selective nature described.
D. Periodic permeability - This term is not mentioned in the passage and does not describe the function.
The option that matches the term used in the passage is B. selective permeability. Therefore, the correct answer is B. selective permeability.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to focus on the specific interaction described involving hydrogen and oxygen. The statement "In the presence of oxygen, hydrogen can interact to make water" is a direct explanation of what occurs when hydrogen and oxygen react together.
- **Hydrogen and Oxygen Reaction:** When hydrogen (H₂) gas reacts with oxygen (O₂) gas, they undergo a chemical reaction known as combustion or oxidation. This process forms water (H₂O) as a product.
Now let's evaluate the answer options:
A. Water - This option matches the result of the chemical interaction described: hydrogen and oxygen form water.
B. Acid - While acids can contain hydrogen, oxygen, and other elements, this isn't the specific product formed by the direct interaction of hydrogen and oxygen under typical conditions.
C. Helium - Helium is a noble gas and is not formed from the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen.
D. Carbon - Carbon is an element and not formed in the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.
Thus, based on the information given and the correspondence with the scientific reaction described, the correct answer is:
A. Water

Q: support:             The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed. The greater the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is. For example, light refracts more when it passes from air to diamond than it does when it passes from air to water. That’s because the speed of light is slower in diamond than it is in water.             question:             The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium is known as what?             options:             A. frequency B. resonance C. bounce D. refraction
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to use the information provided in the support section, along with our understanding of the terminology related to the behavior of light.
1. **Understanding the Context**:
   - The support section explains the phenomenon where light changes direction when it enters a different medium. This change in direction or bending is related to the change in speed of light as it moves from one medium to another.
2. **Key Term to Identify**:
   - The question specifically asks for the term used to describe the "angle at which light bends" when entering a different medium.
3. **Looking at the Options**:
   - Option A: Frequency - Frequency relates to the number of waves that pass a point in one second. It is not related to the bending of light.
   - Option B: Resonance - Resonance generally refers to the amplification of a particular frequency of a wave. It is not related to the bending of light in different media.
   - Option C: Bounce - This could imply reflection, but the context is bending, not bouncing off a surface.
   - Option D: Refraction - Refraction is the correct term used in optics to describe the change in direction of a wave passing from one medium into another, due to its change in

Q: support:             The Energy Cycle Whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate molecules. But if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially when it has been shown that the gas organisms release as a “waste product” (CO2) acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in photosynthesis? Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. In addition, an organism can either make its own food or eat another organism—either way, the food still needs to be broken down. Finally, in the process of breaking down food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce “waste” in the form of CO2 gas. In nature, there is no such thing as waste. Every single atom of matter and energy is conserved, recycling over and over infinitely. Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but their constituent atoms never disappear (Figure 8.20). CO2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis. Both are byproducts of reactions that move on to other reactions. Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular respiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Both processes use electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive other reactions. These two powerhouse processes, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining energy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun.             question:             Whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down these?             options:             A. lipid molecules B. protein molecules C. carbohydrate molecules D. oxygen molecules
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we will analyze the information provided in the support text.
1. The text states, "all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate molecules."
2. No mention is made of lipid or protein molecules as the main source of energy in this context.
3. Oxygen is involved in aerobic respiration but is not broken down to release energy. Instead, it is used in the breakdown of carbons in carbohydrates.
4. Carbohydrate molecules are explicitly mentioned as the type of molecules that living things break down to access energy.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:
C. carbohydrate molecules

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to think about what type of energy is most directly associated with the motion of molecules.
1. **Kinetic Energy**: This is the energy that an object possesses due to its motion. For molecules, increasing the temperature increases their motion because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules. 
2. **Residual Energy**: This is not a standard term commonly used in physics to describe energy related to the motion of molecules, especially in the context of temperature changes.
3. **Compression Energy**: This refers to energy associated with the compression of materials, and is not directly related to the motion of molecules due to temperature.
4. **Emotional Energy**: This is not a scientific term related to molecular motion or energy in the context of physics.
Based on the standard definitions and what they represent, the most appropriate answer to the question "Increasing the temperature of N2 molecules increases what energy of motion?" is:
A. kinetic energy

Q: support:             FM radio is inherently less subject to noise from stray radio sources than AM radio. The reason is that amplitudes of waves add. So an AM receiver would interpret noise added onto the amplitude of its carrier wave as part of the information. An FM receiver can be made to reject amplitudes other than that of the basic carrier wave and only look for variations in frequency. It is thus easier to reject noise from FM, since noise produces a variation in amplitude. Television is also broadcast on electromagnetic waves. Since the waves must carry a great deal of visual as well as audio information, each channel requires a larger range of frequencies than simple radio transmission. TV channels utilize frequencies in the range of 54 to 88 MHz and 174 to 222 MHz. (The entire FM radio band lies between channels 88 MHz and 174 MHz. ) These TV channels are called VHF (for very high frequency). Other channels called UHF (for ultra high frequency) utilize an even higher frequency range of 470 to 1000 MHz. The TV video signal is AM, while the TV audio is FM. Note that these frequencies are those of free transmission with the user utilizing an old-fashioned roof antenna. Satellite dishes and cable transmission of TV occurs at significantly higher frequencies and is rapidly evolving with the use of the high-definition or HD format.             question:             Which radio frequency should you listen to if you want less noise?             options:             A. cb B. am C. wave D. fm
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which radio frequency has less noise, we need to understand how AM and FM radio operate differently.
- AM (Amplitude Modulation) radio is more susceptible to noise because noises generally affect the amplitude of waves, and AM signals are modulated by changing the amplitude of the carrier wave. Therefore, any noise that affects amplitude is likely to interfere with an AM signal and be interpreted as part of the information.
- FM (Frequency Modulation) radio, on the other hand, varies the frequency of the carrier wave to encode the information. Because it is based on frequency changes rather than amplitude changes, an FM receiver can reject amplitude noise and focus only on variations in frequency. This makes FM radio inherently less subject to noise from stray radio sources compared to AM radio.
Based on this explanation, FM radio would be the frequency you should listen to if you want less noise.
Therefore, the correct option is:
D. fm

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. fm

Q: support:             The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations. Abiotic factors such as soil quality, water, and climate will determine the species that continue the process of succession. Mosses and grasses will be able to grow in the newly created soil. During early succession, plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take over the landscape. Over time, these plants improve the soil and a few shrubs can begin to grow. Slowly, the shrubs are replaced by small trees. Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees. Since trees are more successful at competing for resources than shrubs and grasses, a forest may be the end result of primary succession.             question:             What's the term for the gradual progression from simple plants to larger more complex ones in an area?             options:             A. complex progression B. pattern progression C. primary pattern D. primary succession
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct term for the gradual progression from simple plants to larger, more complex ones in an area, we need to understand the options provided and relate them to the description given.
The passage describes a sequence of ecological development: starting with pioneer species like mosses, grasses, and eventually progressing to shrubs, small trees, and finally a forest of larger trees. This process is commonly known in ecology as "succession."
Now, let's examine the options:
A. Complex progression - This is not a recognized ecological term. While it describes the progression as complex, it doesn't specify the ecological process involving changes in species over time.
B. Pattern progression - This also is not a recognized term in ecology. It mentions "progression", but "pattern" doesn't align specifically with ecological terminology regarding species succession.
C. Primary pattern - This is another term that lacks recognition in ecological context. "Primary" can be related to the beginning stages, but "pattern" doesn’t align with the usual terminology.

Q: support:                          question:             Fungi may form mutualistic relationships with plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and what?             options:             A. animals B. eggs C. farmers D. plants
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to consider where fungi typically form mutualistic relationships. Beyond plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, fungi are also known to form mutualistic relationships with animals. 
One well-known mutualistic relationship involving fungi and animals is the relationship between certain fungi and insects like leaf-cutter ants or termites. These insects cultivate fungi as a food source, and in return, the fungi benefit from a supply of plant material provided by the insects.
Now, let's take a look at the options:
A. Animals - As discussed, fungi can have mutualistic relationships with animals.
B. Eggs - Eggs do not usually form mutualistic relationships with fungi.
C. Farmers - While farmers may benefit from fungi (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi), this is not a direct mutualistic relationship.
D. Plants - Plants are already mentioned in the question.
Thus, the correct answer is option A. animals.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. animals

Q: support:             The pressure of the earth’s atmosphere, as with any fluid, increases with the height of the column of air. In the case of earth’s atmosphere, there are some complications. The density of the air is not uniform but decreases with altitude. Additionally there is no distinct top surface from which height can be measured. We can, however, calculate the approximate difference in pressure between two altitudes using the equation . The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 1.013 × 10 5 Pa. This pressure is often expressed as 101.3 kPa.             question:             What happens to the density of air as the altitude decreases?             options:             A. decreases B. multiplies C. remains the same D. increases
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what happens to the density of air as the altitude decreases, we need to consider the relationship between altitude and air density.
1. **Understanding Air Density and Altitude**: Air density refers to the mass of air per unit volume. At higher altitudes, there is less air above a given surface area, resulting in lower atmospheric pressure and lower air density. Conversely, at lower altitudes, there is more air above a given surface area, resulting in higher atmospheric pressure and higher air density.
2. **Atmospheric Pressure and Density Relationship**: As the altitude decreases (meaning you are closer to sea level), the atmospheric pressure increases because there is more air above you. This increase in atmospheric pressure is associated with an increase in air density because the air molecules are more compressed and packed closer together.
3. **Conclusion Based on Decreasing Altitude**: Therefore, as the altitude decreases, the density of air increases.
The correct answer is:
D. increases

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. increases

Q: support:             Some animals change their depth by changing their density. Recall that things that are denser than their surroundings sink while those that are less dense than their surroundings float. Most fish have a swim bladder, a special sac that is filled with gases from their blood. When the fish's swim bladder is full, it is less dense than the surrounding water and the fish will rise towards the surface. Another property of water that affects lakes is the unique changes in density during phase changes. The density of most substances increases when a liquid becomes a solid. This is not so for water: Solid water is actually less dense than liquid water. It is for this reason that ice floats. Can you imagine a world where ice sank? Lakes would freeze from the bottom up, killing many fish. Frozen water in the Polar Regions would sink and change the ocean levels. The fact that ice floats is essential for the survival of many aquatic ecosystems and ultimately life on Earth. Besides the changes in density, there are other ways in which the phase changes of water have significant impacts. When water is trapped in small cracks in rocks, it will expand as it freezes and break up the rock causing weathering. The transpiration (evaporation) of water from a good-sized tree can move 1800 liters of water out of the ground in a single day. Sublimation, the phase change between solid and gas, is responsible for the formation of frost. As you can see, water has many special properties that make its role in nature unique. It is considered the "universal solvent” because its bipolar molecule enables it to dissolve a wide variety of substances. Water is the only substance that occurs naturally in all three states; solid, liquid, and gas. Water is truly a miracle for life!.             question:             How do some animals change their depth?             options:             A. spontaneous mutations B. mass migration C. by changing their density D. metamorphosis
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how some animals change their depth, we need to refer to the information provided in the passage. The passage states that some animals, such as fish, change their depth by changing their density. Specifically, it mentions that fish possess a swim bladder, a sac filled with gases from their blood, which affects their buoyancy. When the swim bladder is full, it lowers the fish's density compared to the surrounding water, causing the fish to rise.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. Spontaneous mutations - This is unrelated to how animals change their depth; it refers to changes in genetic material.
B. Mass migration - This involves the movement of a group of animals from one location to another and does not relate to adjusting depth.
C. By changing their density - This aligns with the information provided in the passage, as it mentions the swim bladder's role in changing a fish's density to adjust its depth.
D. Metamorphosis - This refers to a biological process of significant change in the body structure, which is unrelated to how animals change their depth.
Based on the explanation above, the correct answer is C. by changing their density.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. by changing their density.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify the phenomenon responsible for crowding out other species and exacerbating the causes of extinction. Let's evaluate each option:
A. Climate change: While climate change is a significant factor affecting species and their habitats, the question specifically mentions crowding out, which implies direct competition for space or resources.
B. Human suburbanization: Suburbanization involves the expansion of human settlements into natural areas, which indeed impacts other species. However, it is not as broadly encompassing as overpopulation in affecting all causes of extinction.
C. Migration: Migration itself is the movement of species or populations from one place to another. It does not inherently crowd out other species or directly worsen all causes of extinction in the same context provided.
D. Human overpopulation: Human overpopulation directly refers to the excessive number of humans in a particular area, leading to resource depletion and space competition with other species. It contributes to habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and other extinction causes.
Given the explanation above, the option that best completes the statement by crowding out other species and exacerbating all the other causes of extinction is:
D. human overpopulation.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to understand the term "dessication" and how it relates to animals.
1. Definition of "Dessication": Dessication refers to extreme dryness or the removal of moisture. In biological terms, it involves the loss of water content from an organism or tissue.
2. Relation to Animals: Dessication in animals refers to the loss of water to such an extent that it becomes harmful or fatal. This condition primarily involves dehydration, where the body doesn't have enough water to function properly.
3. Reviewing Options:
   - A. Diarrhea: This is a condition that involves frequent, watery bowel movements. While it can lead to dehydration, it is not directly synonymous with dessication.
   - B. Dehydration: This refers directly to the lack of water in the body, making it synonymous with the effects of dessication in this context.
   - C. Depletion: This term is vague and could refer to the reduction of various substances, not specifically water.
   - D. Starvation: This refers to the lack of food or nutrients, which is not directly related to the concept of dessication.
4. Conclusion: The most accurate answer is B. dehydration, since dessication is an extreme form of dehydration in animals.

Q: support:             Internal Respiration Internal respiration is gas exchange that occurs at the level of body tissues (Figure 22.23). Similar to external respiration, internal respiration also occurs as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient. However, the partial pressure gradients are opposite of those present at the respiratory membrane. The partial pressure of oxygen in tissues is low, about 40 mm Hg, because oxygen is continuously used for cellular respiration. In contrast, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is about 100 mm Hg. This creates a pressure gradient that causes oxygen to dissociate from hemoglobin, diffuse out of the blood, cross the interstitial space, and enter the tissue. Hemoglobin that has little oxygen bound to it loses much of its brightness, so that blood returning to the heart is more burgundy in color. Considering that cellular respiration continuously produces carbon dioxide, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is lower in the blood than it is in the tissue, causing carbon dioxide to diffuse out of the tissue, cross the interstitial fluid, and enter the blood. It is then carried back to the lungs either bound to hemoglobin, dissolved in plasma, or in a converted form. By the time blood returns to the heart, the partial pressure of oxygen has returned to about 40 mm Hg, and the partial pressure.             question:             Internal and external forms of what life process occur as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient?             options:             A. photosynthesis B. metabolism C. respiration D. reproduction
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to understand what the passage is describing.
1. The passage discusses "internal respiration" and mentions a similar process called "external respiration." These are forms of a physiological process related to breathing and gas exchange.
   
2. It describes how gas exchange occurs at the level of body tissues (internal respiration) and mentions a similar process at the respiratory membrane. Both involve a "partial pressure gradient."
3. The passage further clarifies that the partial pressure gradient is responsible for the simple diffusion of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide).
4. "Respiration" is specifically the process that involves the exchange of gases—taking in oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. The description in the passage aligns with this definition.
5. It explicitly uses the terms "internal respiration" and "external respiration," which are directly related to the process of respiration as they describe gas exchange at the cellular and alveolar levels in the body, respectively.
Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is:
C. respiration

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. respiration

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's first understand the context: 
1. **Concept to Understand**: The statement mentions that after each "mass extinction," new species evolve to fill the habitats where old species lived. This is a well-documented event in the fossil record.
2. **Question Interpretation**: The question is asking which type of event is followed by the evolution of new species to occupy habitats where previous species existed.
3. **Analysis of Options**: 
   - A. **Mass Extinction**: This involves a substantial and widespread loss of species, leading to empty habitats and ecological niches. It is typically followed by adaptive radiations where new species evolve and occupy the vacated niches. This matches the description in the statement.
   - B. **Moderate Extinction**: This term implies a less severe impact on biodiversity than mass extinction. It is not a standard term used in paleontology.
   - C. **Minor Extinction**: As the name suggests, minor extinctions affect only a few species and do not usually lead to significant opportunities for new species to evolve on a large scale.
   - D. **Formation Extinction**: This is not a recognized term in the context of extinctions and species evolution.

Q: support:             Populations usually grow bigger when they have what they need. How fast they grow depends on birth and death rates. They grow more slowly as they get close to the carrying capacity. This is the biggest population the environment can support.             question:             When populations get close to the carrying capacity, what happens to growth?             options:             A. dies B. halts C. spikes D. slows
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what happens to population growth as it approaches carrying capacity, we need to understand the concept of carrying capacity in ecology:
1. **Carrying Capacity**: This is the maximum population size that an environment can sustain indefinitely without being degraded. It's determined by the availability of resources such as food, water, and shelter.
2. **Population Growth Dynamics**:
   - When a population is well below carrying capacity, resources are abundant, and populations can grow rapidly.
   - As the population increases and approaches the carrying capacity, resources become limited. This limitation slows down the growth because there's less available to support additional individuals.
3. **Understanding the Options**:
   - Option A: "dies" suggests the entire population would die, which isn't accurate in this context. Some individuals might die due to competition, but not the entire population.
   - Option B: "halts" would mean the population growth stops completely, which might not necessarily be true; it slows down but doesn't stop instantly.
   - Option C: "spikes" indicates a rapid increase, which contradicts the idea of approaching a resource limit.
   - Option D: "slows" is consistent with the concept of resource limitation as populations near carrying capacity.

Q: support:             Although air can transfer heat rapidly by convection, it is a poor conductor and thus a good insulator. The amount of available space for airflow determines whether air acts as an insulator or conductor. The space between the inside and outside walls of a house, for example, is about 9 cm (3.5 in) —large enough for convection to work effectively. The addition of wall insulation prevents airflow, so heat loss (or gain) is decreased. Similarly, the gap between the two panes of a double-paned window is about 1 cm, which prevents convection and takes advantage of air’s low conductivity to prevent greater loss. Fur, fiber, and fiberglass also take advantage of the low conductivity of air by trapping it in spaces too small to support convection, as shown in the figure. Fur and feathers are lightweight and thus ideal for the protection of animals.             question:             Although air can transfer heat rapidly by convection, it is a poor conductor and thus a good what?             options:             A. insulator B. transporter C. absorber D. magnet
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks us to determine what air is good at, given that it is a poor conductor. Based on the passage provided, we know that air, due to its poor conductivity, acts as a good insulator. The fact that adding wall insulation and having double-paned windows prevents airflow and takes advantage of air's low conductivity suggests that air is being used to insulate, not to transfer or absorb anything specifically, and certainly not to act as a magnet.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. Insulator - This aligns perfectly with the passage's explanation of how air's poor conductivity makes it a good insulator.
B. Transporter - This would suggest air is good at moving things, which doesn't align with the passage's focus on air as a poor conductor used to insulate.
C. Absorber - While air can absorb some heat, the passage emphasizes its role as an insulator rather than an absorber.
D. Magnet - This is unrelated to the passage's discussion of air and heat conduction.
Given this analysis, the answer is clearly:
A. Insulator

These satellites have a bird's eye view of how the planet is changing ( Figure below ).             question:             What man-made devices in space are used to observe the earth's surface?             options:             A. satellites B. sensors C. telescopes D. crystals
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which man-made devices in space are used to observe the Earth's surface, we need to consider the context given in the text. 
1. The text describes various ways to observe the Earth's surface, including from land and from space.
2. Importantly, the text mentions that many important observations of the Earth's surface are made by "orbiting satellites" which have a bird's eye view of how the planet is changing. This is a key detail indicating that satellites are specifically used for this purpose.
3. We know telescopes are often used for observing distant objects in space, not specifically the Earth's surface.
4. Sensors, while important for collecting data, are generally components installed on instruments like satellites and are not independent devices sent into space.
5. Crystals are materials and not devices used for observation.
From this breakdown, the correct option that aligns with the text is:
A. satellites
Satellites are the man-made devices in space used to observe the Earth's surface as described.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. satellites

Q: support:             Diseases of the endocrine system are relatively common. An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough hormone. When too much hormone is secreted, it is called hypersecretion. When not enough hormone is secreted, it is called hyposecretion.             question:             An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough of what?             options:             A. sweat B. enzyme C. metabolite D. hormone
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to examine the information provided in the context or support.
1. The context discusses diseases related to the endocrine system, which involves hormones.
2. It specifies that an endocrine disease is characterized by either the secretion of too much or not enough of a certain substance.
3. The terms "hypersecretion" and "hyposecretion" are introduced, which refer to the excessive or insufficient secretion of that substance.
4. The key point here is to identify what exactly is secreted in an endocrine system context, which is "hormone" as indicated by hypersecretion (too much hormone) and hyposecretion (not enough hormone).
Given this reasoning, the question "An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough of what?" is asking about the substance whose abnormal secretion characterizes endocrine diseases.
The options provided are:
A. Sweat
B. Enzyme
C. Metabolite
D. Hormone
- "Sweat" is not involved in endocrine diseases in the context of the information given.
- "Enzyme" is not specifically linked to the secretions mentioned here.
- "Metabolite" is a broader term that doesn't pertain directly to the primary concern of endocrine diseases.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. hormone

Q: support:             For thousands of years, humans have understood that characteristics such as eye color, hair color, or even flower color are passed from one generation to the next. The passing of characteristics from parent to offspring is called heredity . Humans have long been interested in understanding heredity. Many hereditary mechanisms were developed by scholars but were not properly tested or quantified. The scientific study of genetics did not begin until the late 19 th century. In experiments with garden peas, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel described the basic patterns of inheritance. Keep in mind that while we know about DNA and its role as the genetic material, Mendel did not know of the existence of DNA. Nor did he understand the concept of the chromosome or the process of meiosis, and yet, he was still able to correctly describe basic inheritance patterns.             question:             In experiments with garden peas, austrian monk gregor mendel described the basic patterns of what?             options:             A. inheritance B. behavior C. color D. preference
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we should refer to the provided support text:
1. The text states, "In experiments with garden peas, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel described the basic patterns of inheritance." This indicates the main focus of Mendel's work.
2. We should identify the key phrase "basic patterns" in the question. According to the text, Mendel described the "basic patterns of inheritance."
3. Look at the options provided:
   - A. inheritance 
   - B. behavior 
   - C. color 
   - D. preference
4. Option A, "inheritance," directly corresponds to the information given in the text about Mendel's experiments and his conclusions.

Q: support:             24.7 Nutrition and Diet Nutrition and diet affect your metabolism. More energy is required to break down fats and proteins than carbohydrates; however, all excess calories that are ingested will be stored as fat in the body. On average, a person requires 1500 to 2000 calories for normal daily activity, although routine exercise will increase that amount. If you ingest more than that, the remainder is stored for later use. Conversely, if you ingest less than that, the energy stores in your body will be depleted. Both the quantity and quality of the food you eat affect your metabolism and can affect your overall health. Eating too much or too little can result in serious medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Vitamins and minerals are essential parts of the diet. They are needed for the proper function of metabolic pathways in the body. Vitamins are not stored in the body, so they must be obtained from the diet or synthesized from precursors available in the diet. Minerals are also obtained from the diet, but they are also stored, primarily in skeletal tissues.             question:             Nutrition and diet affect your metabolism. more energy is required to break down fats and proteins than this?             options:             A. minerals B. carbohydrates C. electrolytes D. vitamins
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to focus on the main point about how different nutrients affect metabolism. The text states that more energy is required to break down fats and proteins compared to other nutrients.
- The options presented are minerals, carbohydrates, electrolytes, and vitamins.
- Fats and proteins are macronutrients that require more energy to break down, which is part of the metabolic process.
- Carbohydrates are another macronutrient.
- The other options, minerals and vitamins, are not typically broken down for energy; instead, they play roles in various bodily functions, including metabolism.
- Electrolytes, which are included in the options, are minerals, and their primary role is in maintaining fluid balance and nerve function, not as an energy source.
Since carbohydrates are broken down with less energy compared to fats and proteins, it aligns with the idea that more energy is required to break down fats and proteins than carbohydrates.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. carbohydrates

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. carbohydrates

Q: support:             The adductor muscle that closes the jaw is composed of two muscles in mammals: the temporalis and the masseter. These allow side-to-side movement of the jaw, making chewing possible, which is unique to mammals. Most mammals have heterodont teeth, meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth. Most mammals are diphyodonts, meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or “baby” teeth, and permanent teeth. Other vertebrates are polyphyodonts, that is, their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life. Mammals, like birds, possess a four-chambered heart. Mammals also have a specialized group of cardiac fibers located in the walls of their right atrium called the sinoatrial node, or pacemaker, which determines the rate at which the heart beats. Mammalian erythrocytes (red blood cells) do not have nuclei, whereas the erythrocytes of other vertebrates are nucleated. The kidneys of mammals have a portion of the nephron called the loop of Henle or nephritic loop, which allows mammals to produce urine with a high concentration of solutes, higher than that of the blood. Mammals lack a renal portal system, which is a system of veins that moves blood from the hind or lower limbs and region of the tail to the kidneys. Renal portal systems are present in all other vertebrates except jawless fishes. A urinary bladder is present in all mammals. Mammalian brains have certain characteristics that differ from other vertebrates. In some, but not all mammals, the cerebral cortex, the outermost part of the cerebrum, is highly folded, allowing for a greater surface area than is possible with a smooth cortex. The optic lobes, located in the midbrain, are divided into two parts in mammals, whereas other vertebrates.             question:             A unique characteristic of mammals is the ability to chew, this happens by the temporalis and the masseter allowing what?             options:             A. side-to-side movement B. Bakward and forward C. Up and down D. Grinding
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option, let's break down the information given in the passage related to jaw movement in mammals:
1. The passage states that the adductor muscle, which includes the temporalis and the masseter, is responsible for closing the jaw in mammals.
2. It specifically mentions that these muscles "allow side-to-side movement of the jaw," which is essential for the process of chewing.
3. This side-to-side movement is highlighted as unique to mammals and important for their ability to chew food.
Given this analysis, the unique characteristic of mammals related to chewing is the jaw's side-to-side movement enabled by the temporalis and the masseter muscles. 
Therefore, the correct option is:
A. side-to-side movement

All sexual behaviors that involve contact between mucous membranes put a person at risk for infection. This includes vaginal, anal, and oral sexual behaviors. Many STIs can also be transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, and breast milk. Therefore, behaviors such as sharing injection or tattoo needles is another way these STIs can spread.             question:             Most of the pathogens that cause stis enter the body through mucous membranes of which organs?             options:             A. eyes B. stomach C. kidneys D. reproductive organs

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question about what kind of buds induce branching, we need to consider the biological process related to plant growth. Branching in plants is typically induced by the activation of specific types of buds. Let's analyze the options:
A. **Axillary buds** - These are buds that form at the junctions (axils) where leaves attach to the stems. In many plants, the activation of axillary buds leads to the growth of lateral branches. Therefore, axillary buds are indeed responsible for branching.
B. **Lymphatic buds** - Lymphatic relates to the lymphatic system in animals, not plants. Therefore, lymphatic buds are not related to plant branching.
C. **Leafy buds** - While leafy buds could refer to buds that develop leaves, the term is not specifically associated with branching. The typical term used for branching is axillary buds.
D. **Arterial buds** - The term "arterial" refers to arteries, which are part of the circulatory system in animals, not relevant to plants. Thus, arterial buds do not relate to plant branching.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option A: axillary buds.

Q: support:             Male Reproductive System Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition in which a man has difficulty either initiating or maintaining an erection. The combined prevalence of minimal, moderate, and complete ED is approximately 40 percent in men at age 40, and reaches nearly 70 percent by 70 years of age. In addition to aging, ED is associated with diabetes, vascular disease, psychiatric disorders, prostate disorders, the use of some drugs such as certain antidepressants, and problems with the testes resulting in low testosterone concentrations. These physical and emotional conditions can lead to interruptions in the vasodilation pathway and result in an inability to achieve an erection. Recall that the release of NO induces relaxation of the smooth muscles that surround the penile arteries, leading to the vasodilation necessary to achieve an erection. To reverse the process of vasodilation, an enzyme called phosphodiesterase (PDE) degrades a key component of the NO signaling pathway called cGMP. There are several different forms of this enzyme, and PDE type 5 is the type of PDE found in the tissues of the penis. Scientists discovered that inhibiting PDE5 increases blood flow, and allows vasodilation of the penis to occur. PDEs and the vasodilation signaling pathway are found in the vasculature in other parts of the body. In the 1990s, clinical trials of a PDE5 inhibitor called sildenafil were initiated to treat hypertension and angina pectoris (chest pain caused by poor blood flow through the heart). The trial showed that the drug was not effective at treating heart conditions, but many men experienced erection and priapism (erection lasting longer than 4 hours). Because of this, a clinical trial was started to investigate the ability of sildenafil to promote erections in men suffering from ED. In 1998, the FDA approved the drug, marketed as Viagra®. Since approval of the drug, sildenafil and similar PDE inhibitors now generate over a billion dollars a year in sales, and are reported to be effective in treating approximately 70 to 85 percent of cases of ED. Importantly, men with health problems—especially those with cardiac disease taking nitrates—should avoid Viagra or talk to their physician to find out if they are a candidate for the use of this drug, as deaths have been reported for at-risk users.             question:             What percentage of men suffer from some form of erectile dysfunction by age 40?             options:             A. approximately 40 percent B. approximately 60 percent C. approximately 80 percent D. approximately 10 percent

By expelling a stream of mucopolysaccharides from the raphe, the diatom can attach to surfaces or propel itself in one direction.             question:             The diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic protists that encase themselves in intricately patterned, glassy cell walls composed of silicon dioxide in a matrix of organic particles. these protists are a component of freshwater and these?             options:             A. source plankton B. land plankton C. waste plankton D. marine plankton
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's break down the information provided:
1. **The Subject**: We are discussing diatoms, which are unicellular photosynthetic protists.
2. **Structure and Composition**: Diatoms encase themselves in intricately patterned, glassy cell walls composed of silicon dioxide.
3. **Habitat**: According to the passage, diatoms are a component of both freshwater and another type of plankton.
The question is asking us to identify the type of plankton, alongside freshwater, that diatoms are a component of. Let's look at the options provided:
A. source plankton  
B. land plankton  
C. waste plankton  
D. marine plankton  
From the passage, it explicitly mentions that diatoms are a component of "freshwater and marine plankton." Therefore, option D, "marine plankton," is the correct answer.
Thus, the answer is: **D. marine plankton**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. marine plankton.

Q: support:             Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are the greatest energy source for modern society. Millions of years ago, plants used energy from the Sun to form carbon compounds. These compounds were later transformed into coal, oil, or natural gas. Fossil fuels take millions of years to form. For this reason, they are non-renewable. We will use most fossil fuels up in a matter of decades. Burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of pollution. The most important of these may be the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.             question:             Millions of years ago, plants used energy from the sun to form what?             options:             A. carbon compounds B. evolution C. greenhouse gases D. fossil fuels
A: Let's think step by step.
To tackle the question, we need to identify what plants used energy from the Sun to form millions of years ago. The provided information states: "Millions of years ago, plants used energy from the Sun to form carbon compounds."
Now, we need to match this information to the correct option:
A. carbon compounds - This option matches exactly with the information given in the text.
B. evolution - This option is unrelated to the process described.
C. greenhouse gases - This is incorrect because the text specifies carbon compounds, not greenhouse gases.
D. fossil fuels - This is incorrect because fossil fuels are what carbon compounds eventually become, not what plants directly form.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. carbon compounds

Q: support:             The other idea is that evolution occurs by natural selection. Natural selection is the process in which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring than others do. This results in changes in the traits of living things over time.             question:             What is the term for the process in which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring than others do?             options:             A. natural variety B. natural selection C. natural process D. natural survival
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer to the question "What is the term for the process in which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring than others do?" we should refer to the given support information.
The support states: "The other idea is that evolution occurs by natural selection. Natural selection is the process in which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring than others do."
From this, we can directly see that the term that matches the description "the process in which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring than others do" is "natural selection."
Now, let's examine the options:
A. natural variety - This option does not match the description as "variety" does not refer to a reproductive process.
B. natural selection - This is the correct term as indicated in the support statement.
C. natural process - This is a broader term and does not specifically refer to the described process.
D. natural survival - This is not a recognized term in evolutionary biology that describes the reproductive advantage described.
Therefore, the correct answer is B. natural selection.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. natural selection.

Q: support:             The amount of reactants and products do not have to be equal. However, after equilibrium is attained, the amounts of reactants and products will be constant.             question:             In a chemical reaction, the amounts of reactants and products will be constant when what state is attained?             options:             A. homogeneity B. peak C. equilibrium D. saturation
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when the amounts of reactants and products will be constant in a chemical reaction, we need to consider the concept of chemical equilibrium. At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, meaning that the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time, though they are not necessarily equal.
Let's evaluate the options:
A. Homogeneity - In a homogeneous mixture, all components are in a single phase, but this doesn't specifically relate to the concentrations of reactants and products being constant.
B. Peak - This term more commonly refers to the maximum point of something (such as a peak in a concentration graph), not necessarily to equilibrium in a chemical reaction.
C. Equilibrium - In the context of chemical reactions, this is when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, resulting in constant reactant and product concentrations.
D. Saturation - This term is more often associated with solutions, where no more solute can dissolve, and does not directly describe equilibrium in a chemical reaction.
Based on the explanation above, the option that accurately describes when the amounts of reactants and products will be constant in a chemical reaction is:
C. equilibrium

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. equilibrium

Q: support:             Gravity has traditionally been defined as a force of attraction between things that have mass. According to this conception of gravity, anything that has mass, no matter how small, exerts gravity on other matter. Gravity can act between objects that are not even touching. In fact, gravity can act over very long distances. However, the farther two objects are from each other, the weaker is the force of gravity between them. Less massive objects also have less gravity than more massive objects.             question:             What is the term for the force of attraction between things that have a mass?             options:             A. weight B. magnetism C. motion D. gravity
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct term for the force of attraction between things that have mass, let's analyze the options one by one:
A. **Weight**: Weight is the force exerted on a mass due to gravity. It is not the force of attraction itself but a consequence of the gravitational force acting on a mass in a gravitational field, such as the Earth's gravity acting on a person.
B. **Magnetism**: Magnetism is a force of attraction or repulsion that acts between electrically charged particles or magnets. It is not related to the force of attraction due to mass but rather to electric charges and magnetic materials.
C. **Motion**: Motion is the action or process of moving or being moved. It does not refer to any force and is unrelated to the force of attraction between masses.
D. **Gravity**: Gravity is traditionally defined as the force of attraction between objects that have mass. This force acts between any two masses, however small, and over long distances. Therefore, gravity is the appropriate term for the force described.
Based on this analysis, the term for the force of attraction between things that have mass is **D. gravity**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. gravity.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question about the long, thin protein extensions in most prokaryotic cells, we need to analyze each option:
A. Neutrons - Neutrons are subatomic particles found in the nucleus of an atom. They do not relate to cellular structures, so this is not the correct answer.
B. Flagellum - A flagellum is a long, whip-like structure that protrudes from the cell body of certain cells, including many prokaryotic cells, and aids in locomotion. Prokaryotic cells often have flagella for movement, making this a strong candidate.
C. Analyte - An analyte is a substance whose chemical constituents are being identified and measured, not a cellular structure. This is not related to the question.
D. Cingulum - In biological terms, a cingulum refers to a ridge or band, often related to different organisms' anatomy, but not specifically related to prokaryotic cells in terms of extensions.
Considering these definitions, the most fitting option for the long, thin protein extensions in most prokaryotic cells is B. Flagellum.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct preventive measure for protecting young children against diseases such as viral meningitis, let's evaluate the options:
A. Surgical intervention: This is not a common preventive measure for viral infections like viral meningitis. Surgical intervention is typically not used as a preventative strategy for infectious diseases.
B. Malnutrition: Malnutrition does not offer any protective measures against diseases. In fact, malnutrition can weaken the immune system and make individuals more susceptible to infections.
C. Vaccination: Vaccination is a well-known preventive measure against infectious diseases, including viral diseases like viral meningitis. Vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to protect the body from specific pathogens.
D. Nutrition: While good nutrition supports the immune system, it is not a specific preventive measure against viral meningitis. It contributes to overall health but does not provide targeted protection like vaccines.
Given the context that children as young as 2 years old can be vaccinated against viral meningitis, it is clear that option C, vaccination, is the correct preventive measure. Vaccination directly protects against specific infectious diseases, including viral meningitis.
Therefore, the answer is C. vaccination.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between renal plasma flow, blood flow, and hematocrit.
1. **Definition of Terms:**
   - **Renal Plasma Flow (RPF):** This refers to the volume of plasma that passes through the kidneys per unit time, typically measured in mL/min.
   - **Blood Flow:** The total volume of blood (both plasma and cells) passing through the kidneys per unit time.
   - **Hematocrit:** The fraction or percentage of blood volume that is composed of erythrocytes (red blood cells).
2. **Given Information in the Support:**
   - The support provides that "renal plasma flow equals the blood flow per minute times the hematocrit."
   - The formula presented seems a bit confusing because typically, plasma flow is actually calculated as the blood flow multiplied by (1 - hematocrit) since hematocrit is the fraction of blood that is made up of cells (not plasma).
3. **Calculation in the Example:**
   - According to the example, if a person has a hematocrit of 45%, then the plasma flow equals 55% of the blood flow. This makes sense because if 45% of the blood is cells (

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's first understand what lattice energy is. Lattice energy is the amount of energy released when ions in the gaseous state come together to form an ionic solid. It is also the energy required to separate one mole of an ionic solid into its gaseous ions.
The key point here is that lattice energy is directly related to the strength of the interactions between the ions in the solid, which are ionic bonds. The stronger the bonds between the ions, the higher the lattice energy of the compound. 
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- A. bonds: This option is about the interactions between the ions, which is exactly what lattice energy measures.
- B. atoms: Lattice energy doesn't measure the strength of atoms themselves; it focuses on the strength of the ionic bonds between them.
- C. metals: Lattice energy is related to ionic compounds, which may involve metal ions, but it specifically measures the ionic bonds rather than the metals themselves.
- D. electrons: While electrons play a role in bond formation, lattice energy measures the energy of ionic bonds rather than any specific property of electrons.
Therefore, the correct option that matches the description of what lattice energy measures is A. bonds.

A: Let's think step by step.
Taste buds can detect a limited number of distinct tastes. The basic types of taste that have been traditionally recognized are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. This corresponds to the following analysis:
1. **Sweet**: This taste is typically associated with sugars and certain proteins.
2. **Sour**: Detected by hydrogen ions, this taste is often associated with acidic substances.
3. **Salty**: This taste is primarily due to the presence of sodium ions.
4. **Bitter**: Many different chemicals, including some that are toxic, are detected as bitter.
5. **Umami**: Often referred to as savory, this taste is associated with amino acids like glutamate.
From this step-by-step analysis, we can conclude that there are five basic types of tastes that can be detected by taste buds. Thus, the correct option is:
A. five

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify what fits the description provided in the context.
1. The description states that the sores are located in the lining of the stomach or duodenum.
2. These sores are typically caused by bacterial infections or the acidic environment of the stomach.
3. The context explicitly mentions "ulcers" as being sores in the lining of the stomach or duodenum caused by these factors.
Now, let's consider the options:
- A. lesions - While lesions can refer to any abnormal tissue, it is not specific to the context of sores caused by acidity or bacteria.
- B. hernia - A hernia is a different medical condition related to the protrusion of an organ through a structure, not sores in the stomach lining.
- C. ulcers - As identified in the context, this term directly refers to the sores discussed in the scenario.
- D. clots - Clots refer to a mass of coagulated blood and are unrelated to the description.
From this analysis, the correct answer is:
C. ulcers

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which factor has led to the evolution of alternative male mating behavior and morphology in some species, let's analyze the options:
A. Sexual selection: This is a form of natural selection where certain traits increase an individual’s chances of mating and passing on their genes. In many species, sexual selection can lead to the evolution of diverse mating strategies and distinctive morphological traits that enhance reproductive success.
B. Distributive selection: This appears to be a misspelling or misunderstanding. However, if we consider "disruptive selection," it refers to a type of natural selection that favors extreme values for a trait, leading to two or more contrasting phenotypes that can evolve in separate directions.
C. Sexual process: This term is not as clearly defined as the others in the context of evolutionary biology. It may refer broadly to the processes and strategies related to reproduction, but it lacks specificity regarding selection pressures.
D. Similar selection: This term is ambiguous as it’s not a standard term in evolutionary biology. It would need to refer to a specific mechanism of natural selection to be considered viable.
Upon analyzing these options, "A. sexual selection" is the most likely factor leading to the evolution of alternative male mating behavior and morphology in some species. This process encourages males to develop strategies or

Q: support:             Less energy is needed to get renewable energy sources. Solar energy is a good example. Sunlight is everywhere, so no one needs to go out and find it. We don’t have to drill for it or pump it to the surface. We just need to install solar panels like the ones in Figure below and let sunlight strike them. The energy from the sunlight is changed to electricity. The electricity is used to power lights and appliances in the house. So solar energy doesn't have to be transported.             question:             What renewable energy source converts energy from the sunlight into electricity?             options:             A. hydrostatic energy B. geothermal energy C. geophysical energy D. solar energy
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify the renewable energy source mentioned in the passage that converts sunlight into electricity. The passage describes solar energy as a renewable energy source that utilizes sunlight. It mentions that solar panels are used to convert sunlight into electricity, which is then used to power lights and appliances.
Now, let's evaluate the provided options:
A. Hydrostatic energy - This refers to energy derived from the pressure of stationary water, unrelated to sunlight.
B. Geothermal energy - This involves harnessing energy from the Earth's internal heat, also not related to sunlight.
C. Geophysical energy - This term is not commonly used to describe a specific kind of renewable energy source.
D. Solar energy - As described in the passage, this involves converting sunlight into electricity using solar panels.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:
D. solar energy

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. solar energy

Q: support:             Arteries Serving the Upper Limbs As the subclavian artery exits the thorax into the axillary region, it is renamed the axillary artery. Although it does branch and supply blood to the region near the head of the humerus (via the humeral circumflex arteries), the majority of the vessel continues into the upper arm, or brachium, and becomes the brachial artery (Figure 20.31). The brachial artery supplies blood to much of the brachial region and divides at the elbow into several smaller branches, including the deep brachial arteries, which provide blood to the posterior surface of the arm, and the ulnar collateral arteries, which supply blood to the region of the elbow. As the brachial artery approaches the coronoid fossa, it bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries, which continue into the forearm, or antebrachium. The radial artery and ulnar artery parallel their namesake bones, giving off smaller branches until they reach the wrist, or carpal region. At this level, they fuse to form the superficial and deep palmar arches that supply blood to the hand, as well as the digital arteries that supply blood to the digits. Figure 20.32 shows the distribution of systemic arteries from the heart into the upper limb. Table 20.9 summarizes the arteries serving the upper limbs.             question:             The radial artery and which artery parallel their namesake bones, giving off smaller branches until they reach the wrist, or carpal region?             options:             A. biceps B. triceps C. humerus D. ulnar
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify which artery, along with the radial artery, parallels a bone in the forearm (antebrachium) and gives off smaller branches until reaching the wrist (carpal region).
1. The radial artery is already mentioned in the question as paralleling its namesake bone—the radius.
2. We need to identify which other artery parallels a bone in the forearm.
3. In the passage, it is mentioned that the brachial artery bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries. The radial artery parallels the radius, and the ulnar artery is the other major artery in the forearm.
4. The ulnar artery parallels the ulna bone.
Thus, the radial artery and the ulnar artery parallel their respective bones (radius and ulna) and give off smaller branches until they reach the wrist.
Given the options:
A. biceps (muscle) - Not applicable.
B. triceps (muscle) - Not applicable.
C. humerus (bone in the upper arm) - Not applicable.
D. ulnar (artery paralleling the ulna bone) - Correct choice.
So, the correct answer is: D. ulnar.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. ulnar.

Q: support:             The Phosphorus Cycle Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a major component of nucleic acids and phospholipids, and, as calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones. Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for growth) in aquatic, particularly freshwater, ecosystems. Phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO43-). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity, natural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. However, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may also be significant phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of Earth’s surface. (Figure 20.13) Phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine organisms. The movement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion having an oceanic residence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years.             question:             Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their what?             options:             A. ancestors B. excretions C. skeletons D. blood
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks about the primary sources from which phosphate-containing ocean sediments form. According to the provided information, these sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their "excretions." This is mentioned explicitly in the passage. 
- Option A, "ancestors," is not mentioned in the context of forming ocean sediments.
- Option C, "skeletons," while possibly related to bodies, is not explicitly mentioned in the text as a primary source in this context.
- Option D, "blood," is not referenced at all in the passage regarding sediment formation.
Therefore, the correct answer is B. excretions.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. excretions.

To determine what erosion does to pieces of broken rock, let's analyze each option:
A. Lead them - This option implies guiding or directing the rocks but isn't typically associated with what erosion does.
B. Smooth them - While erosion can lead to the smoothing of rocks, the statement specifically says "moves the pieces," which suggests movement rather than smoothing.

Sweetened iced tea is a solution in which solid sugar (the solute) is dissolved in cold liquid tea, which is mostly water (the solvent). When you add sugar to tea, particles of water pull apart particles of sugar. The particles of sugar spread throughout the tea, making all of it taste sweet.             question:             In a glass of sweet tea the sugar is known as the solute and the water is known as what?             options:             A. solvent B. calcium C. solid D. pigment
A: Let's think step by step.
In the context of solutions, a solute is the substance that is dissolved, while a solvent is the substance that does the dissolving. In this case, sugar is noted as the solute because it is the solid substance being dissolved in the iced tea. Water is the primary component of the tea and acts as the liquid medium that dissolves the sugar, spreading the sugar particles throughout the tea. Therefore, water is referred to as the solvent.

Q: support:             can occur in electrolytic cells by introducing a power supply, which supplies the energy to force the electrons to flow in the nonspontaneous direction. Electrolysis is done in solutions, which contain enough ions so current can flow. If the solution contains only one material, like the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, it is a simple matter to determine what is oxidized and what is reduced. In more complicated systems, like the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride, more than one species can be oxidized or reduced and the standard reduction potentials are used to determine the most likely oxidation (the half-reaction with the largest [most positive] standard reduction potential) and reduction (the half-reaction with the smallest [least positive] standard reduction potential). Sometimes unexpected half-reactions occur because of overpotential. Overpotential is the difference between the theoretical half-reaction reduction potential and the actual voltage required. When present, the applied potential must be increased, making it possible for a different reaction to occur in the electrolytic cell. The total charge, Q, that passes through an electrolytic cell can be expressed as the current (I) multiplied by time (Q = It) or as the moles of electrons (n) multiplied by Faraday’s constant (Q = nF). These relationships can be used to determine things like the amount of material used or generated during electrolysis, how long the reaction must proceed, or what value of the current is required.             question:             The difference between the theoretical half-reaction reduction potential and the actual voltage required is called what?             options:             A. overcharge B. overpotential C. excess D. resistance
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage explains that when unexpected half-reactions occur in an electrolytic cell, it is due to the difference between the theoretical half-reaction reduction potential and the actual voltage required. This difference is specifically identified as "overpotential" in the text.

Given this explanation, the correct answer to the question is:
B. overpotential

Q: support:             Small nonpolar molecules can easily diffuse across the cell membrane. However, due to the hydrophobic nature of the lipids that make up cell membranes, polar molecules (such as water) and ions cannot do so. Instead, they diffuse across the membrane through transport proteins. A transport protein completely spans the membrane, and allows certain molecules or ions to diffuse across the membrane. Channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.             question:             Due to the __________ nature of the lipids that make up cell membranes, polar molecules (such as water) and ions cannot easily diffuse across the cell membrane.             options:             A. hydrophobic B. saturated C. catalytic D. hydrophylic
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option for filling the blank, let's analyze the information given.
The passage states that small nonpolar molecules can easily diffuse across the cell membrane, but polar molecules and ions cannot, due to the nature of the lipids in the membrane.
1. **Nature of lipid molecules:** The cell membrane is primarily composed of phospholipids that have hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads. The hydrophobic tails create a barrier that is resistant to polar substances.
2. **Interaction with polar molecules:** "Hydrophobic" refers to the characteristic of repelling water and other polar substances. Since the passage explains that polar molecules and ions cannot easily diffuse across the membrane, it's because the lipid bilayer is hydrophobic.
Now, let's examine each option:
A. **Hydrophobic** - This matches the explanation as hydrophobic substances repel polar molecules and water.
B. **Saturated** - While saturation refers to the presence or absence of double bonds in the fatty acids' hydrocarbon chains, it isn't directly about polarity or permeability to polar molecules.
C. **Catalytic** - This term refers to the ability to accelerate chemical reactions, unrelated to the diffusing ability of molecules through membranes.
D. **Hydrophilic** - This would attract water and polar substances

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. hydrophobic

A: Let's think step by step.
High temperatures can have a significant impact on biological cells. The process of "denaturing proteins" refers to the structural alteration of proteins, which can lead to a loss of their biological function. Proteins are crucial for various cellular functions, and their denaturation can disrupt vital processes within the cell.
When proteins are denatured due to high temperatures, the normal physiological processes are negatively affected, leading to cellular damage. This often results in the cell being unable to sustain life, eventually leading to cell death. Consequently, high temperatures often have a lethal effect on cells by denaturing proteins and disrupting their normal function.
Thus, the correct answer is:
A. kills them

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. kills them

Q: support:             Role of Feedback Loops The contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here. Positive feedback loops are characterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release. The release of oxytocin during childbirth is a positive feedback loop. The initial release of oxytocin begins to signal the uterine muscles to contract, which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch. This, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to release more oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify. The release of oxytocin decreases after the birth of the child. The more common method of hormone regulation is the negative feedback loop. Negative feedback is characterized by the inhibition of further secretion of a hormone in response to adequate levels of that hormone. This allows blood levels of the hormone to be regulated within a narrow range. An example of a negative feedback loop is the release of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal glands, as directed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. As glucocorticoid concentrations in the blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the adrenal glands to prevent additional glucocorticoid secretion (Figure 17.6).             question:             By allowing blood levels of a hormone to be regulated within a narrow range, feedback loops contribute to maintaining what state?             options:             A. hypothesis B. hibernation C. consciousness D. homeostasis
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information related to feedback loops and their effects:
1. **Feedback Loops and Hormone Regulation**:
   - Feedback loops are systems whereby the system's output can influence its function and processes. 
   - There are two types of feedback loops mentioned: positive feedback and negative feedback.
   - Positive feedback loops amplify responses and processes, such as the release of more oxytocin during childbirth.
   - Negative feedback loops work to inhibit or down-regulate processes to maintain stability.
2. **Effect of Feedback Loops**:
   - The passage specifically mentions that negative feedback loops allow blood levels of hormones to be regulated within a narrow range. 
   - This regulation helps maintain the stability of internal conditions.
3. **Contribution to Homeostasis**:
   - "Homeostasis" refers to the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living organisms. This involves the regulation of physiological processes at constant, optimal levels.
   - The passage indicates that feedback loops contribute to maintaining homeostasis by keeping hormone levels stable.
4. **Examining the Options**:
   - A. Hypothesis: A proposed explanation for a phenomenon; unrelated to the regulation of physiological states.
   - B. Hibernation: A state of inactivity and

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. homeostasis.

Q: support:             Connective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance Three main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen fiber is made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while flexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience and strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body. Elastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main property of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are prominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column. Reticular fiber is also formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain narrow and are arrayed in a branching network. They are found throughout the body, but are most abundant in the reticular tissue of soft organs, such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the parenchyma (the functional cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ). All of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by fibroblasts, ground substance is made of polysaccharides, specifically hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with a protein core and.             question:             Collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers comprise what type of tissue?             options:             A. skin tissue B. intestine tissue C. nucleus tissue D. connective tissue
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which type of tissue collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers comprise, let's go through the information provided:
1. **Collagen fibers** - These fibers are made from fibrous protein subunits and are known for their great tensile strength, flexibility, and resistance to stretching. They hold connective tissues together and are found in ligaments and tendons, providing resilience and strength.
2. **Elastic fibers** - These fibers contain elastin and are known for their ability to return to their original shape after being stretched or compressed. They are found in elastic tissues, particularly in the skin and elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.
3. **Reticular fibers** - These are formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers but are thinner and formed in a branching network. They are mainly found in the soft organs like the liver and spleen, providing structural support.
These fibers are embedded in ground substance, which is secreted by fibroblasts and is a characteristic feature of connective tissues.
Given this information, it is clear that collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers are components of **connective tissue**. Therefore, the answer to the question is:
D. connective tissue

Q: support:             Introduction Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy. Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use energy while thinking, and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported into the cell, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and possibly distributed to the entire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are built from smaller molecules imported from dietary amino acids. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport of molecules into and out of cells. In addition, processes such as ingesting and breaking down pathogenic bacteria and viruses, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the cell require energy. From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. This chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed with great efficiency.             question:             Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires this?             options:             A. metals B. energy C. solids D. mineral
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks, "Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires this?" To answer this, we should consider the topic of energy usage in living organisms as mentioned in the provided text.
1. The introduction highlights that "Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy." This directly addresses the question by stating what living organisms need to perform tasks.
2. The text elaborates on various activities within living cells, such as importing, metabolizing, synthesizing molecules, etc., all of which require energy.
3. The text also explicitly states that "energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport of molecules into and out of cells."
Considering these points, it is clear that energy is the key requirement for virtually every task performed by living organisms. Hence, the correct answer from the options provided is:

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the roles of the given options in the immune system, particularly in the context of eliminating antigens through phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis.
1. **Fats** (Option A): Fats are primarily involved in energy storage, signaling, and acting as structural components of cell membranes. They do not play a direct role in the binding to antigens for the purpose of their elimination.
2. **Antibodies** (Option B): Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins produced by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses. They bind specifically to antigens, marking them for destruction. This binding facilitates processes such as phagocytosis, where immune cells engulf and digest the marked pathogens, and complement-mediated lysis, where a series of proteins (complement system) are activated leading to the lysis (breaking down) of the pathogen's cell membrane.
3. **Amino Acids** (Option C): Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. While essential for various biological functions, they do not directly bind to antigens in the immune response.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which muscles are used to pump water over the gills, we need to think about the anatomy and function of fish.
1. **Fish Anatomy**: Fish use gills to extract oxygen from water. The movement of water over the gills is crucial for respiration.
2. **Breathing Mechanism**: Fish generally use a combination of jaw and buccal (mouth) movements, along with movements of the pharynx, to create a flow of water over their gills.
3. **Key Muscles Involved**:
   - **Jaws**: The opening and closing of the mouth (jaws) can help draw water in.
   - **Pharynx**: The pharyngeal muscles are involved in pushing the water from the mouth over the gills.
4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A. pharynx and tonsils**: Tonsils are not relevant in fish anatomy for this function.

Systematic errors can be caused by faulty instrumentation or faulty technique. The difference between accuracy and precision is demonstrated in Skill Builder ES7.             question:             When a series of measurements is precise but not what, the error is usually systematic?             options:             A. color B. accurate C. length D. velocity
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to focus on the context given in the statement. The passage mentions that "when a series of measurements is precise but not accurate, the error is usually systematic." 
Here, the passage distinguishes between precision and accuracy:
- Precision refers to the consistency or repeatability of measurements.
- Accuracy refers to how close these measurements are to the true or accepted value.
The statement explains that precision is high, but accuracy is lacking, which is usually caused by systematic errors. This means the measurements are close to each other (precise), but not close to the true value (not accurate).
The question asks: "When a series of measurements is precise but not what, the error is usually systematic?" The answer should fill in the blank describing what the measurements are not. Given the explanation, the measurements lack accuracy.
So, the answer that correctly completes the sentence is:

A: Let's think step by step.
During times of environmental stress, organisms often turn to sexual reproduction rather than asexual reproduction. This is because sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two parents, resulting in offspring with greater genetic diversity. This genetic diversity can provide a better chance of survival in changing or harsh environmental conditions, as it increases the likelihood that some offspring will possess traits that are well-suited to the new conditions.
In contrast, asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring, which may not be advantageous in a stressful environment if the parent organism's traits are not suitable for survival under those conditions.
Given this understanding, the correct answer is:
B. sexual reproduction

The question asks for the completion of a sentence by identifying what can change the energy of an object. In the provided context, it is stated that the energy of an object can be changed by three things: the transfer of heat, work performed on or by an object, or some combination of two elements.
Now, let's analyze the options:
A. heat and work - This option directly aligns with the given passage, which states that energy changes can result from the transfer of heat or work, or a combination of both. This is the correct and logical choice.
B. cold and energy - The passage does not mention cold as a factor, and "energy" is too broad and not specified in combination with another term like work.
C. temperature and work - Although temperature is related to heat, the passage specifically mentions the transfer of heat, not temperature itself, making this option not accurate.
D. humidity and work - Humidity is not mentioned at all in the passage as a factor affecting the energy of an object.
Considering the specifics of the passage and the way the options align with it, the correct answer is A. heat and work.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. heat and work

Q: support:             A cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell. The cell wall contains not only cellulose and protein, but other polysaccharides as well. In fact, two other classes of polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and pectic polysaccharides, can comprise 30% of the dry mass of the cell wall. The cell wall provides structural support and protection. Pores in the cell wall allow water and nutrients to move into and out of the cell. The cell wall also prevents the plant cell from bursting when water enters the cell.             question:             What is the rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell?             options:             A. cell root B. cell barrier C. cell shield D. cell wall
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we will evaluate the information provided in the context.
1. The passage states that "A cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell."
2. The question asks for the name of the rigid layer found outside the cell membrane that surrounds the cell.
Based on the passage:
- The rigid layer described is the "cell wall."
Let's match the correct option with this information:
- Option A: cell root - No reference to "cell root" in the context.
- Option B: cell barrier - The term "cell barrier" is not explicitly mentioned and could be confused with various structures.
- Option C: cell shield - "Cell shield" doesn't appear in the context.
- Option D: cell wall - Matches the description provided in the context as a rigid structure outside the cell membrane.
Therefore, the correct answer is D. cell wall.

Q: support:             Intrapleural pressure is the pressure of the air within the pleural cavity, between the visceral and parietal pleurae. Similar to intra-alveolar pressure, intrapleural pressure also changes during the different phases of breathing. However, due to certain characteristics of the lungs, the intrapleural pressure is always lower than, or negative to, the intra-alveolar pressure (and therefore also to atmospheric pressure). Although it fluctuates during inspiration and expiration, intrapleural pressure remains approximately –4 mm Hg throughout the breathing cycle. Competing forces within the thorax cause the formation of the negative intrapleural pressure. One of these forces relates to the elasticity of the lungs themselves—elastic tissue pulls the lungs inward, away from the thoracic wall. Surface tension of alveolar fluid, which is mostly water, also creates an inward pull of the lung tissue. This inward tension from the lungs is countered by opposing forces from the pleural fluid and thoracic wall. Surface tension within the pleural cavity pulls the lungs outward. Too much or too little pleural fluid would hinder the creation of the negative intrapleural pressure; therefore, the level must be closely monitored by the mesothelial cells and drained by the lymphatic system. Since the parietal pleura is attached to the thoracic wall, the natural elasticity of the chest wall opposes the inward pull of the lungs. Ultimately, the outward pull is slightly greater than the inward pull, creating the –4 mm Hg intrapleural pressure relative to the intraalveolar pressure. Transpulmonary pressure is the difference between the intrapleural and intra-alveolar pressures, and it determines the size of the lungs. A higher transpulmonary pressure corresponds to a larger lung.             question:             Surface tension of alveolar fluid, which is mostly water, creates an inward pull of the tissue of what organ?             options:             A. heart B. spleen C. brain D. lung
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what organ the surface tension of alveolar fluid creates an inward pull on, we need to analyze the given information:
1. The alveolar fluid is mentioned in the context of breathing and the pleural cavity.
2. The inward pull due to surface tension is caused by alveolar fluid, which specifically affects the organ involved in respiratory processes where alveoli are present.
3. Alveoli are the tiny air sacs in the lungs.
From this analysis, the organ that experiences an inward pull due to the surface tension of the alveolar fluid is the lung. Therefore, the correct answer is:
D. lung

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. lung

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which type of tumor mostly does not cause serious problems and can be completely removed by surgery, let's examine the options provided:
A. Persistent - This term is generally used to describe something that continues to exist or endure over a prolonged period. It's not specifically related to tumor classification.
B. Benign - Benign tumors are non-cancerous growths in the body. They do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). Benign tumors usually grow slowly and can often be completely removed by surgery without causing serious problems.
C. Malignant - Malignant tumors are cancerous. They have the potential to invade nearby tissues and spread to different parts of the body (metastasize), often causing serious health problems. Surgical removal can be more complex and may not eliminate the disease completely.
D. Toxic - This word generally refers to something harmful or poisonous, not typically used as a classification for tumors.
Based on the analysis of the options:
- Benign tumors are the type that mostly do not cause serious problems and can be completely removed by surgery.
Therefore, the correct answer is B. benign.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. benign

The bones of the rib cage help protect the heart and lungs.             question:             What supports and protects the soft organs of the body?             options:             A. Muscle B. skeleton C. Skin D. skull
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option supports and protects the soft organs of the body, let's examine each choice in the context provided:
- Option A: Muscle. Muscles help in movement and some degree of protection by cushioning, but they are not primarily responsible for supporting and protecting soft organs.
- Option B: Skeleton. The text explicitly states, "The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of the body." This indicates that the skeleton provides the primary structure and defensive role for soft organs.
- Option C: Skin. Skin acts as a protective barrier but is more concerned with protecting the body from external threats like infection or dehydration, rather than structurally supporting organs.
- Option D: Skull. While the skull does protect the brain, it is only a part of the skeleton, which provides comprehensive protection to various soft organs as a collective system.
Based on the text, the correct answer is B. skeleton, as it provides both support and protection to soft organs throughout the entire body.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. skeleton

A: Let's think step by step.
To find the correct answer, let's analyze the information given in the question. We need to identify the term used for the horizontal stems of a strawberry plant that run over the ground surface.
- Option A: Climbing vines - These are stems or plants that grow upwards by attaching themselves to structures, not typically horizontal stems that run along the ground.
- Option B: Root volunteers - This isn't a standard botanical term for horizontal stems. "Volunteers" generally refer to plants that grow on their own naturally, without being deliberately planted.
- Option C: Stolons - This is a botanical term that refers specifically to horizontal stems that run along the ground and can take root at various points to form new plants. The description fits perfectly with the one provided in the question.
- Option D: Sprouts - "Sprouts" generally refer to new shoots or growths from a seed, bulb, or tuber, not horizontal stems that root to form new plants.
Based on this analysis, the correct term for the horizontal stems of a strawberry plant running over the ground and capable of forming new plants is Option C: stolons.

Q: support:             Cell division is just one of several stages that a cell goes through during its lifetime. The cell cycle is a repeating series of events that include growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division. The cell cycle in prokaryotes is quite simple: the cell grows, its DNA replicates, and the cell divides. In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is more complicated.             question:             What is defined as a repeating series of events that include growth, dna synthesis, and cell division?             options:             A. meiosis B. photosynthesis C. cell cycle D. puberty
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option accurately defines "a repeating series of events that include growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division," we'll break down each option:
A. Meiosis: This is a type of cell division that results in four daughter cells each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. It's primarily involved in the production of gametes (e.g., sperm and eggs) and is not a repetitive process that includes stages like growth and DNA synthesis.
B. Photosynthesis: This is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll, typically involving the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen. It is not related to cell division or DNA synthesis in the context of individual cell cycles.
C. Cell cycle: The cell cycle is indeed defined as a repeating series of events that a cell goes through during its lifetime, which includes growth, DNA synthesis, and cell division. In eukaryotic cells, the cell cycle is divided into stages such as G1 (growth), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (preparation for cell division), and M (mitosis or cell division).
D. Puberty: This is a developmental stage that occurs in humans and other animals, leading to sexual maturity.

For example, they might have tentacles for sensing or feeding, “paddles” for swimming, or suckers for clinging to surfaces.             question:             What distinguishing characteristic of annelid anatomy shows specialization and adaptation?             options:             A. asymmetry B. beautiful C. segmentation D. compression
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the distinguishing characteristic of annelid anatomy that shows specialization and adaptation, we need to analyze the given support text:
1. Annelids, such as earthworms, are divided into repeating segments.
2. Segmentation is highlighted as being highly adaptive, allowing for efficient movement.
3. Each segment having its own nerve and muscle tissues supports specialization.
4. Some segments can be specialized for specific functions, such as feeding, swimming, or clinging.
From this information, it becomes clear that segmentation is a key feature that allows for both specialization and adaptation. Therefore, the distinguishing characteristic of annelid anatomy that demonstrates these traits is:
C. segmentation

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. segmentation

Q: support:                          question:             How does water from roots reach the leaves?             options:             A. water-conducting cells B. water-phobic cells C. water - raising cells D. water - combining cells
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how water from the roots reaches the leaves, it's important to consider the structure and function of plant vascular systems.
1. **Vascular System in Plants**: Plants have a vascular system that consists of two main types of tissues: xylem and phloem. Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant.
2. **Xylem Functionality**: The xylem is made up of water-conducting cells, primarily tracheids and vessel elements. These cells are specialized to facilitate the upward movement of water and are adapted to transport water efficiently due to their tubular structure and lignified walls that provide structural support.
3. **Mechanism of Water Transport**:
   - Water is absorbed by the roots from the soil.
   - It enters the xylem vessels and moves upwards through the plant to reach the leaves.
   - The process mainly relies on transpiration (the evaporation of water from the leaves), which creates a negative pressure that pulls water upwards from the roots through the xylem.
Based on the above explanation, the correct option describing how water from the roots reaches the leaves is:
A. water-conducting cells
These are the cells within the xyle

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. water-conducting cells

Q: support:             Boiling Points When the vapor pressure increases enough to equal the external atmospheric pressure, the liquid reaches its boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open containers, this pressure is that due to the earth’s atmosphere. The normal boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.3 kPa). Figure 10.24 shows the variation in vapor pressure with temperature for several different.             question:             What term is used to describe when a liquid is the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings?             options:             A. freezing point B. burning point C. boiling point D. evaporating point
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which term is used to describe the specific condition outlined in the question, we should focus on the key aspect of the definition provided: the temperature at which a liquid's equilibrium vapor pressure equals the pressure exerted by its surroundings. 
1. **Understand the Definitions**:

A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks what is more likely to occur if the land is bare, given the context of runoff. The prompt mentions that runoff is likely to "cause more erosion if the land is bare" and that "plants help hold the soil in place." It also references that the runoff water is brown because it eroded soil from a bare field. This indicates that the primary effect of runoff on bare land is erosion, as opposed to other processes like sedimentation, weathering, or abrasion.
Let's consider the options:
- A. Sediment: While runoff can carry sediment, the primary process being described is the erosion of soil, not just the transport of sediment.
  
- B. Weathering: This process refers to the breaking down of rocks and minerals, primarily in place, and not specifically increased by runoff on bare land.
  
- C. Erosion: Erosion is the process of soil, rock, or other surface material being worn away and removed, especially by water or wind, which aligns perfectly with the context of the question.
- D. Abrasion: Abrasion involves wearing down surfaces through friction or impact, often associated with wind or moving particles, but the question context focuses on runoff.
Therefore, the best answer is clearly C. erosion, as this is

Q: support:             Colon The cecum blends seamlessly with the colon. Upon entering the colon, the food residue first travels up the ascending colon on the right side of the abdomen. At the inferior surface of the liver, the colon bends to form the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure) and becomes the transverse colon. The region defined as hindgut begins with the last third of the transverse colon and continues on. Food residue passing through the transverse colon travels across to the left side of the abdomen, where the colon angles sharply immediately inferior to the spleen, at the left colic flexure (splenic flexure). From there, food residue passes through the descending colon, which runs down the left side of the posterior abdominal wall. After entering the pelvis inferiorly, it becomes the s-shaped sigmoid colon, which extends medially to the midline (Figure 23.21). The ascending and descending colon, and the rectum (discussed next) are located in the retroperitoneum. The transverse and sigmoid colon are tethered to the posterior abdominal wall by the mesocolon.             question:             What organ is subdivided into ascending, descending, transverse and sigmoid parts?             options:             A. heart B. uterus C. colon D. lungs
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the support section:
1. The text states that the cecum blends seamlessly with the colon.
2. It describes the food residue traveling through different parts of the colon: the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon.
3. It mentions specific flexures (bends) within the colon: the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure) and the left colic flexure (splenic flexure).
4. The text also specifies that the transverse and sigmoid colon are tethered by the mesocolon.
The main focus of the information provided is clearly on the "colon" and its subdivisions. 
Now, let's examine the options given:
A. Heart: The heart is an organ composed of chambers (such as the atria and ventricles) but does not have sections called ascending, descending, transverse, and sigmoid.
B. Uterus: The uterus does not have parts labeled as ascending, descending, transverse, and sigmoid.
C. Colon: The provided text specifically describes the colon and its subdivisions: ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid parts.
D. Lungs: The lungs are divided into lobes and segments, but not into parts called ascending,

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct category for ammonia, urea, and uric acid, we need to consider the key elements in these substances.
1. **Ammonia:** This is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula NH₃. It is known for its significant nitrogen content, which is evident from its chemical structure.
2. **Urea:** This is an organic compound with the chemical formula (NH₂)₂CO. Like ammonia, it contains a significant amount of nitrogen, as the 'NH₂' groups in urea stand for amine groups primarily composed of nitrogen.
3. **Uric Acid:** This compound has a chemical formula of C₅H₄N₄O₃. It is a product of the metabolization of purines, which are nitrogen-containing compounds. Hence, uric acid also clearly contains nitrogen.
All three substances - ammonia, urea, and uric acid - contain nitrogen as a key element, primarily related to the body's metabolism of proteins and nucleic acids.
Given this information, the kind of waste represented by ammonia, urea, and uric acid can be categorized as "nitrogenous." Therefore, the correct answer is:

To solve this, we need to understand what "genome sequences" are and how they relate to evolution and development.
1. **Understanding Genome:** A genome is the complete set of DNA in an organism, including all of its genes. Therefore, when we refer to "genome sequences," we are talking about the entire sequence of DNA in a species.
2. **Clues to Evolution and Development:** Comparing genome sequences involves looking at the similarities and differences between the DNA of different organisms. This comparison can provide valuable insights into evolutionary relationships (how species are related through common ancestors) and developmental processes (how organisms grow and develop).
3. **Connecting the Options:** Let's examine the given options and see which aligns with the task of comparing genome sequences:
   - A. **Organisms:** This is a broad term that includes all living things but does not specify what is being compared.
   - B. **Genes:** Genes are specific sequences within a genome, and while they are part of the genome, the question is specifically about "genome sequences," not just gene sequences.
   - C. **Genome:** This is the correct term that encompasses the entire DNA sequence that we compare to obtain clues about evolution and development.
   - D. **DNA:** While DNA is

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. genome

Q: support:             There are other units in chemistry that are important, and we will cover others in the course of the entire book. One of the fundamental quantities in science is temperature. Temperature is a measure of the average amount of energy of motion, or kinetic energy, a system contains. Temperatures are expressed using scales that use units called degrees, and there are several temperature scales in use. In the United States, the commonly used temperature scale is the Fahrenheit scale (symbolized by °F and spoken as “degrees Fahrenheit”). On this scale, the freezing point of liquid water (the temperature at which liquid water turns to solid ice) is 32°F, and the boiling point of water (the temperature at which liquid water turns to steam) is 212°F. Science also uses other scales to express temperature. The Celsius scale (symbolized by °C and spoken as “degrees Celsius”) is a temperature scale where 0°C is the freezing point of water and 100°C is the boiling point of water; the scale is divided into 100 divisions between these two landmarks and extended higher and lower. By comparing the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, a conversion between the two scales can be determined: °C=(°F–32) × 59° Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.             question:             What is a measure of the average amount of energy of motion, or kinetic energy, a system contains called?             options:             A. precipitation B. size C. temperature D. variation

Q: support:             U92235 + n01® B56141a + K3692r + 3n01 This hypothesis was confirmed by detecting the krypton-92 fission product. As discussed in Section 20.2 "Nuclear Reactions", the nucleus usually divides asymmetrically rather than into two equal parts, and the fission of a given nuclide does not give the same products every time. In a typical nuclear fission reaction, more than one neutron is released by each dividing nucleus. When these neutrons collide with and induce fission in other neighboring nuclei, a self-sustaining series of nuclear fission reactions known as anuclear chain reaction can result (Figure 20.16 "The Curve of Nuclear Binding Energy"). For example, the fission of 235U releases two to three neutrons per fission event. If absorbed by other 235U nuclei, those neutrons induce additional fission events, and the rate of the fission reaction increases geometrically. Each series of events is called a generation. Experimentally, it is found that some minimum mass of a fissile isotope is required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction; if the mass is too low, too many neutrons are able to escape without being captured and inducing a fission reaction. The minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission is called the critical mass. This amount depends on the purity of the material and the shape of the mass, which corresponds to the amount of surface area available from which neutrons can escape, and on the identity of the isotope. If the mass of the fissile isotope is greater than the critical mass, then under the right conditions, the resulting supercritical mass can release energy explosively. The enormous energy released from nuclear chain reactions is responsible for the massive destruction caused by the detonation of nuclear weapons such as fission bombs, but it also forms the basis of the nuclear power industry. Nuclear fusion, in which two light nuclei combine to produce a heavier, more stable nucleus, is the opposite of nuclear fission. As in the nuclear transmutation reactions discussed in Section 20.2 "Nuclear.             question:             What is the minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission called?             options:             A. particular mass B. concentrated mass C. baseline mass D. critical mass
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the answer, we need to identify the term used for the minimum mass required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. According to the passage, this term is "critical mass." The passage specifically states: "The minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission is called the critical mass."
Therefore, the answer is:
D. critical mass

Q: support:             Microtubules guide the formation of the plant cell wall. Cellulose is laid down by enzymes to form the primary cell wall. Some plants also have a secondary cell wall. The secondary wall contains a lignin, a secondary cell component in plant cells that have completed cell growth/expansion.             question:             The secondary wall contains _________ , a secondary cell component in plant cells that have completed cell growth/expansion.             options:             A. cellulose B. lignin C. cytoplasm D. glucogen
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to focus on the statement provided in the support section. It mentions that the secondary wall contains a specific component which is associated with plant cells that have completed growth or expansion. 
1. The primary cell wall is formed with cellulose laid down by enzymes. 
2. The secondary wall, which forms after the primary wall, contains a different substance.
3. According to the statement, the substance found in the secondary cell wall that plays a role once the plant cell has completed its growth is lignin.
Given the provided options:
- Option A: cellulose - While cellulose is a major component of the primary cell wall, it is not the distinctive component mentioned for secondary cell walls in the context of completed cell growth or expansion.
- Option B: lignin - This matches the description given in the context, as lignin is known for providing rigidity and is commonly found in secondary cell walls in mature plant cells.
- Option C: cytoplasm - The cytoplasm is part of the cell's internal structure, not specifically a component of the cell wall.

Q: support:             The cell cycle is a repeating series of events, characterizing the life of a eukaryotic cell.             question:             What does the cell cycle do?             options:             A. only reproduce cells B. divide and reproduce cells C. only divide cells D. create new cells
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what the cell cycle does, we need to consider its overall purpose and stages. The cell cycle is essential for the growth and reproduction of eukaryotic cells. It consists of several phases, including interphase (which involves cell growth and DNA replication) and mitosis (which involves the division of the cell's nucleus, followed by cytokinesis where the cell itself divides).
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. Only reproduce cells - This is not entirely accurate because the cell cycle involves both the growth and division of cells, not just reproduction.
B. Divide and reproduce cells - This option captures both the division (mitosis and cytokinesis) and production of new cells, which is the essence of what the cell cycle does. 
C. Only divide cells - This is not accurate because the cell cycle involves more than just division; it prepares the cell to reproduce new cells.
D. Create new cells - While this is part of the outcome, "create" is not as precise as "divide and reproduce," which captures the process.
Therefore, the most accurate description of what the cell cycle does is option B: divide and reproduce cells.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. Divide and reproduce cells.

Q: support:             Inside the nasal area of the skull, the nasal cavity is divided into halves by the nasal septum. The upper portion of the nasal septum is formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone and the lower portion is the vomer bone. Each side of the nasal cavity is triangular in shape, with a broad inferior space that narrows superiorly. When looking into the nasal cavity from the front of the skull, two bony plates are seen projecting from each lateral wall. The larger of these is the inferior nasal concha, an independent bone of the skull. Located just above the inferior concha is the middle nasal concha, which is part of the ethmoid bone. A third bony plate, also part of the ethmoid bone, is the superior nasal concha. It is much smaller and out of sight, above the middle concha. The superior nasal concha is located just lateral to the perpendicular plate, in the upper nasal cavity.             question:             Inside the nasal area of the skull, the nasal cavity is divided into halves by the what?             options:             A. cytoplasm B. cerebral cortex C. nasal septum D. cell wall
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to identify which structure divides the nasal cavity into halves. 
1. The question is asking about the division inside the nasal area of the skull, specifically referring to the nasal cavity.
2. Let's review the options:
   - A. cytoplasm: This is the jelly-like substance found within the cell, not related to the structure of the nasal cavity.
   - B. cerebral cortex: This is part of the brain's cerebrum, unrelated to the nasal cavity's structure.
   - C. nasal septum: The passage provided states that "the nasal cavity is divided into halves by the nasal septum."
   - D. cell wall: This refers to the rigid layer that surrounds the cells of plants and certain organisms, not related to the structure of the nasal cavity.
3. Based on the information given in the passage and the understanding of the terms, the nasal septum is the correct anatomical structure that divides the nasal cavity into halves.
Therefore, the answer is C. nasal septum.

Q: support:             Bacteria can also be chemotrophs. Chemosynthetic bacteria, or chemotrophs , obtain energy by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment. An example of one of these chemicals broken down by bacteria is nitrogen-containing ammonia. These bacteria are important because they help cycle nitrogen through the environment for other living things to use. Nitrogen cannot be made by living organisms, so it must be continually recycled. Organisms need nitrogen to make organic compounds, such as DNA.             question:             Bacteria can be chemotrophs, which obtain what by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment?             options:             A. energy B. chemials C. food D. waste
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we should analyze the provided information carefully:
1. **Understanding Chemotrophs**: The passage states that "Bacteria can also be chemotrophs." Chemotrophs are organisms that obtain their energy by breaking down chemical compounds.
2. **What Bacteria Obtain**: The passage explains that "Chemosynthetic bacteria, or chemotrophs, obtain energy by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment."
3. **Verification of the Question**: The question is asking what bacteria as chemotrophs obtain by breaking down chemical compounds.
4. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A. energy**: This matches the information provided in the passage that chemotrophs obtain energy.
   - **B. chemicals**: While bacteria break down chemicals, they don't "obtain" chemicals in this process.
   - **C. food**: The passage doesn't state that they obtain food. They obtain energy, which can be a result of breaking down compounds that might be considered food.
   - **D. waste**: Waste is generally what is left after the process, not something obtained.
From this analysis, the information in the passage clearly supports that the correct option is **A. energy**.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the context of each option in relation to the threats listed: habitat loss, introduced species, overharvesting, and global change.
A. The Earth's gravity: Gravity is a fundamental force and is not affected by the factors mentioned. Habitat loss, introduced species, overharvesting, and global change do not influence gravity.
B. Biodiversity: Biodiversity refers to the variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem. Habitat loss directly reduces the available environment for many species, introduced species can outcompete, prey on, or bring diseases to native species, overharvesting depletes populations of certain species faster than they can reproduce, and global change (such as climate change) can alter ecosystems drastically. All of these threats are well-known to impact biodiversity negatively.
C. Transportation: Transportation is related to the movement of people and goods. While global change might affect transportation indirectly (for example, by affecting infrastructure through extreme weather), habitat loss, introduced species, and overharvesting do not directly relate to transportation.
D. The Sun: The Sun is a star and is not affected by habitat loss, introduced species, overharvesting, or global change, as these are Earth-specific issues.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what "plumbing" structures inside the veins maintain a unidirectional flow of blood despite the low blood pressure, let's consider each option:
A. Tubes - While veins are indeed tube-like structures, the term "tubes" doesn't specifically address what ensures the directionality of blood flow.
B. Funnels - Funnels are not structures found in the human circulatory system; this option is not relevant.
C. Pumps - Pumps are mechanical devices that move fluids. In the human body, the heart acts as a pump. However, within the veins themselves at the structural level, there are no pumps.
D. Valves - Valves are structures that open and close to regulate and direct the flow of blood. In the veins, valves are essential for maintaining a unidirectional flow of blood toward the heart, especially in the extremities where blood pressure is lower.
Given this reasoning, the correct answer is D. valves. Valves in the veins prevent backflow and ensure that blood moves in one direction despite the low blood pressure in the venous system.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. valves. Valves are the structures inside the veins that maintain a unidirectional flow of blood despite the low blood pressure.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify the term for the process where pollen is transferred from an anther to a stigma in angiosperms.
1. **Understanding the terms:**
   - **Anther:** The part of a flower’s stamen that contains the pollen.
   - **Stigma:** The part of the pistil where pollen germinates.
   - **Angiosperms:** A group of plants that have flowers and produce seeds enclosed within a carpel.
2. **What is being asked:** 
   - We are looking for the name of the process that involves the transfer of pollen to facilitate fertilization in the flower.
3. **Analyzing the options:**
   - **A. wind:** This is a method of pollen transfer (pollination) and not the name of the process itself.
   - **B. pollination:** This is indeed the process of transferring pollen from the male anther to the female stigma.
   - **C. evolution:** This is a biological process by which species change over time; unrelated to pollen transfer.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what an erythrocyte is and what it primarily contains. An erythrocyte, also known as a red blood cell, is responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body.
1. **Role of Hemoglobin:** 
   - Hemoglobin is the protein in erythrocytes that binds to oxygen. It's critical for the red blood cell's primary function of oxygen transport. Each red blood cell contains a large number of hemoglobin molecules to efficiently carry oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body and bring carbon dioxide back for exhalation.
2. **Other Options Analysis:**
   - **Plasma:** Plasma is not found within red blood cells. It is the liquid component of blood in which cells are suspended.
   - **Calcium and Potassium:** These are elements that play various roles in bodily functions, including blood clotting (calcium) and maintaining cell potential (potassium), but they are not the primary molecules contained in erythrocytes.
3. **Molecular Count:** 
   - It is known that each erythrocyte contains approximately 250 million molecules of hemoglobin, which supports its function of transporting oxygen.

Q: support:             The Major Divisions of Land Plants Land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue, as detailed in Figure 14.8. Plants that lack vascular tissue formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients are referred to as nonvascular plants. The bryophytes, liverworts, mosses, and hornworts are seedless and nonvascular, and likely appeared early in land plant evolution. Vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and solutes through the plant body. The first vascular plants appeared in the late Ordovician (461–444 million years ago) and were probably similar to lycophytes, which include club mosses (not to be confused with the mosses) and the pterophytes (ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns). Lycophytes and pterophytes are referred to as seedless vascular plants. They do not produce seeds, which are embryos with their stored food reserves protected by a hard casing. The seed plants form the largest group of all existing plants and, hence, dominate the landscape. Seed plants include gymnosperms, most notably conifers, which produce “naked.             question:             Land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of what tissue?             options:             A. disease B. vascular C. root D. bacterial

Q: support:             In some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Emergency treatment is critical for anaphylaxis. Untreated, anaphylaxis can cause a coma or death. Anaphylaxis is vary rare. The vast majority of people will never have an anaphylactic reaction. The life-threatening symptoms of anaphylaxis include:.             question:             What type of treatment is necessary for anaphylaxis?             options:             A. allergy shot B. intensive care C. outpatient D. emergency
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the necessary treatment for anaphylaxis, it is important to focus on the severity and urgency of the condition. 
1. Anaphylaxis is described as a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening.
2. The text emphasizes that "emergency treatment is critical for anaphylaxis."
3. Consequently, quick action is essential to manage anaphylaxis effectively to prevent serious outcomes such as coma or death.
Considering these points, anaphylaxis requires immediate intervention. Let's analyze the options:
- A. Allergy shot: While allergy shots, such as epinephrine, are used to treat anaphylaxis, the term "allergy shot" generally refers to allergen immunotherapy which is not an emergency treatment.
- B. Intensive care: While intensive care might be needed after initial management if severe complications arise, the key term here is "emergency."
- C. Outpatient: Anaphylaxis requires immediate and urgent care, making outpatient settings inadequate for initial treatment.
- D. Emergency: This reflects the immediate and critical nature of the care needed for anaphylaxis.
Therefore, the correct answer is D. emergency.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. emergency.

Q: support:             Salts Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next. A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction.             question:             What substances, which are distinct from acids and bases, form when ions form ionic bonds?             options:             A. salts B. vitamins C. oils D. water molecules
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify what substances are formed when ions form ionic bonds. According to the provided text, salts are formed when ions create ionic bonds. The text explains that salts dissociate into ions that are not H+ or OH– when dissolved in water. In contrast, acids and bases typically yield H+ and OH– ions, respectively.
Now, let's examine the options:
A. Salts: The passage specifically mentions that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds, and they are distinct from acids and bases.
B. Vitamins: These are organic compounds required in small quantities for various bodily functions and are not related to ionic bonds.
C. Oils: These are typically nonpolar substances composed of hydrocarbons and are not formed through ionic bonding.
D. Water molecules: Water has covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen, not ionic bonds. Additionally, it is not a 'substance' formed by ions forming ionic bonds.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:
A. salts

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. salts

You can learn more about the shapes of proteins at this link:.             question:             What is the name for biochemical compounds that consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids?             options:             A. proteins B. protons C. lipids D. hormones
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided:
1. The question asks for the name of biochemical compounds that consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids.
2. The support sentence at the beginning directly states: "Proteins are biochemical compounds that consist of one or more chains of small molecules called amino acids."
3. Therefore, according to the given information, the term for these biochemical compounds is "proteins."
With this understanding, let's examine the options:
- A. proteins: This matches the information given in the support sentence.
- B. protons: Protons are subatomic particles, not biochemical compounds.
- C. lipids: Lipids are a type of biomolecule, but they are not composed of amino acid chains.
- D. hormones: Hormones are signaling molecules that can be proteins, but not all hormones are proteins, so this does not directly answer the question.
Thus, the correct answer is A. proteins.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. proteins.

An ionic compound contains positive metal ions and negative nonmetal ions held together by ionic bonds. (Ions are atoms that have become charged particles because they have either lost or gained electrons. ) An example of a base is sodium hydroxide (NaOH). When it dissolves in water, it produces negative hydroxide ions and positive sodium ions (Na + ). This can be represented by the equation:.             question:             What are the ionic compounds that produce negative hydroxide ions when dissolved in water?             options:             A. bases B. isotopes C. enzymes D. acids
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is correct, we need to understand the definition provided. According to the support text, bases are ionic compounds that produce negative hydroxide ions (OH-) when dissolved in water. The equation for this reaction is given as an example with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), where sodium hydroxide dissociates in water to form hydroxide ions and sodium ions.

In an electrolytic cell, electric current is applied to provide a source of electrons for driving the reaction in a nonspontaneous direction. In a voltaic cell, the reaction goes in a direction that releases electrons spontaneously. In an electrolytic cell, the input of electrons from an external source forces the reaction to go in the opposite direction.             question:             What is the apparatus used for carrying out an electrolysis reaction?             options:             A. an aqueous cell B. Golgi apparatus C. catalyst D. an electrolytic cell
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to determine which option correctly identifies the apparatus used for carrying out an electrolysis reaction. The support statement provided offers a direct answer to this question. 
The support statement begins with: "An electrolytic cell is the apparatus used for carrying out an electrolysis reaction." This statement clearly tells us which apparatus is used, as it directly names the electrolytic cell as the correct apparatus.
Now, let's analyze each of the options provided:
- Option A: an aqueous cell. This is not mentioned in the support statement as the apparatus for electrolysis.

When does each process occur?.             question:             What two ways may light be transmitted?             options:             A. absorption and refraction B. refracted or scattered C. reflected or refracted D. magnified or scattered
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the processes involved when light is transmitted. 
1. **Understanding Transmission**: In the context of light, transmission refers to light passing through a medium. During this process, several things can happen to the light:
   - **Refraction**: This occurs when light travels from one medium to another and changes direction due to a change in speed. Refraction is a common phenomenon observed when light passes through lenses or water.
   - **Scattering**: This occurs when light encounters particles or irregularities within the medium, causing the light to deviate from its original path in multiple directions.
2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **Option A: Absorption and Refraction**: Absorption is not a form of transmission; it is a process where light energy is converted into other forms of energy, like heat, and thus does not pass through.
   - **Option B: Refracted or Scattered**: Both refraction and scattering involve light being altered in its path or direction during transmission through a medium, thus they are both valid forms of transmission.
   - **Option C: Reflected or Refracted**: Reflection involves light bouncing off a surface, not passing through; hence,

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. refracted or scattered

The ovary end of the tube has a fringelike structure that moves in waves. The motion sweeps eggs from the ovary into the tube.             question:             What pair of tubes that extends toward the ovaries features a fringelike structure that sweeps eggs inside?             options:             A. fallopian tubes B. ovarian tubes C. vas deferens D. golgi apparatus
A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking for the pair of tubes that extend toward the ovaries and have a fringelike structure to sweep eggs inside. 
Looking at the options:
A. Fallopian tubes - These are the tubes known for extending from the uterus toward the ovaries and are involved in transporting eggs from the ovaries.
B. Ovarian tubes - This term is not commonly used in human anatomy; the tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus are typically called fallopian tubes.
C. Vas deferens - This is part of the male reproductive system and is responsible for transporting sperm from the testes, so it is not related to the ovaries.
D. Golgi apparatus - This is an organelle found in cells that packages proteins and lipids, and is not part of the reproductive system.
Given this information, the correct answer is option A: fallopian tubes. The fallopian tubes have a fringelike structure called fimbriae, which helps to sweep the eggs from the ovary into the tube.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which sense is related to balance or equilibrium in most animals, we need to consider how animals maintain their balance.
1. **Balance and Equilibrium Systems**: In most animals, the ability to balance and maintain equilibrium is largely connected to the inner ear structures.
2. **Inner Ear**: The inner ear contains the vestibular system, which is crucial for balance. It includes structures such as the semicircular canals and otolith organs, which detect changes in head position and motion.
3. **Hearing Connection**: The inner ear is also an essential component of the auditory system, meaning it plays a role in hearing. Therefore, the sense most closely linked with balance or equilibrium is hearing, due to the dual function of the inner ear in hearing and balance.
4. **Other Senses**:
   - **Vision** plays a role in balance but is not the primary sense for equilibrium.
   - **Tasting** and **feeling** are not directly related to balance.
Based on this reasoning, the answer is option B: hearing.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. hearing

Several explanations have been proposed for this type of.             question:             In a monogamous pairing, a male individual is generally paired with what other type of individual in a sexual relationship?             options:             A. worker B. male C. female D. drone
A: Let's think step by step.
In a monogamous system, the pairing is typically between one male and one female for reproductive purposes. This is a common arrangement in sexually reproducing species where individuals form a partnership for mating. Considering the options: 
- A. worker: This option refers to a role within some animal societies, like bees, and does not typically relate to the notion of sexual pairing in monogamous systems.
- B. male: This implies a pairing between two males, which is not the typical basis for monogamous mating systems focused on reproduction.
- C. female: This option reflects the typical monogamous reproductive pairing of one male with one female.
- D. drone: Like worker, this term refers specifically to a male bee whose primary role is to mate with the queen, and not directly applicable here.
Since monogamous pairings for reproductive purposes are usually between a male and a female in the context of many species, the correct answer is:

Q: support:             Although the masses of the electron, the proton, and the neutron are known to a high degree of precision (Table 1.3 "Properties of Subatomic Particles*"), the mass of any given atom is not simply the sum of the masses of its electrons, protons, and neutrons. For example, the ratio of the masses of 1H (hydrogen) and 2H (deuterium) is actually 0.500384, rather than 0.49979 as predicted from the numbers of neutrons and protons present. Although the difference in mass is small, it is extremely important because it is the source of the huge amounts of energy released in nuclear reactions (Chapter 20 "Nuclear Chemistry"). Because atoms are much too small to measure individually and do not have a charge, there is no convenient way to accurately measure absolute atomic masses. Scientists can measure relative atomic masses very accurately, however, using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. The technique is conceptually similar to the one Thomson used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of the electron. First, electrons are removed from or added to atoms or molecules, thus producing charged particles called ions. When an electric field is applied, the ions are accelerated into a separate chamber where they are deflected from their initial trajectory by a magnetic field, like the electrons in Thomson’s experiment. The extent of the deflection depends on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. By measuring the relative deflection of ions that have the same charge, scientists can determine their relative masses (Figure 1.25 "Determining Relative Atomic Masses Using a Mass Spectrometer"). Thus it is not possible to calculate absolute atomic masses accurately by simply adding together the masses of the electrons, the protons, and the neutrons, and absolute atomic masses cannot be measured, but relative masses can be measured very accurately. It is actually rather common in chemistry to encounter a quantity whose magnitude can be measured only relative to some other quantity, rather than absolutely. We will encounter many other examples later in this text. In such cases,.             question:             What is a mass spectrometer used to measure?             options:             A. optical atomic masses B. relative atomic masses C. subatomic masses D. partial atomic masses
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to understand the primary function of a mass spectrometer as described in the provided explanation.
1. The passage mentions that "Scientists can measure relative atomic masses very accurately using an instrument called a mass spectrometer."
   
2. Further in the passage, it is explained that by using the mass spectrometer, scientists are able to determine "relative masses" of ions by measuring the extent of their deflection in a magnetic field.
3. The passage emphasizes that it is not possible to calculate absolute atomic masses accurately but does suggest that "relative masses can be measured very accurately."
Based on this information, the correct answer to the question, "What is a mass spectrometer used to measure?" would be:
B. relative atomic masses

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, let's examine the options and the concept in question:
1. **Subject Reproduction** - This is not a valid biological term. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
  
2. **Sexual Destruction** - This term does not exist in the biological context and does not relate to the concept of genetic diversity through reproduction.
  
3. **Cellular Reproduction** - This generally refers to the process by which cells reproduce (e.g., mitosis or binary fission), which does not typically involve combining genes from two different parents to create genetic diversity.
  
4. **Sexual Reproduction** - This process involves the combination of genetic material from two different parents (usually through the fusion of sperm and egg cells), leading to genetically diverse offspring.
The question asks for the process that combines sets of genes from two parents resulting in genetically diverse offspring. The correct answer is:
**D. Sexual Reproduction**

Q: support:             Range shifts are already being observed: for example, some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward. The same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations are not moving quickly enough. Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater fishes, reptiles, and mammals. Climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely disappear. The rate of warming appears to be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt seals during the winter months: seals are the only source of protein available to polar bears. A trend to decreasing sea ice coverage has occurred since observations began in the mid-twentieth century. The rate of decline observed in recent years is far greater than previously predicted by climate models. Finally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water. Shorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will disappear entirely. Additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation.             question:             Global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of what?             options:             A. rainforests B. rain C. greenhouse gases D. warmer water
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks about the factors contributing to rising ocean levels due to global warming. It specifically mentions "melt water from glaciers" and asks about the "greater volume of what" that also contributes to rising ocean levels. 
From the support text, we know that global warming causes two main things to raise ocean levels:
1. Melt water from glaciers.
2. The greater volume of warmer water.
The text mentions that as water warms, it expands. This concept is known as thermal expansion, which contributes to rising ocean levels.
Now, let's evaluate the given options:
- A. rainforests: Rainforests do not contribute to the volume of ocean water.
- B. rain: Rain doesn't primarily cause ocean levels to rise in the context of global warming; it's about existing ocean water expanding.
- C. greenhouse gases: Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming but don't directly increase ocean levels.
- D. warmer water: As stated in the text, the greater volume of warmer water contributes to rising sea levels through thermal expansion.
Therefore, the correct option is D. warmer water.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. warmer water.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the definitions of each option:
A. Galaxies: Galaxies are massive systems composed of stars, star clusters, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter, all bound together by gravity. They are much larger than star clusters and contain millions or even billions of stars. Therefore, galaxies are not simply groups of young stars loosely held together by gravity.
B. Constellations: Constellations are patterns or groupings of stars as seen from Earth, which are not necessarily physically related or gravitationally bound. Thus, they do not fit the description of young stars held together by gravity.
C. Closed clusters: The term "closed clusters" is not standard in the context of star groupings. However, it is similar to "globular clusters," which are dense, spherical collections of older stars, tightly bound by gravity. Therefore, it is not the correct answer in this context.
D. Open clusters: Open clusters are indeed groups of young stars that are loosely gravitationally bound. They are often found in the arms of spiral galaxies and contain tens to a few hundred stars. As such, they match the description provided.
Thus, the correct answer is D. open clusters.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. open clusters.

Q: support:             Wind-blown pollen might land anywhere and be wasted. Another adaptation solved this problem. Plants evolved traits that attract specific animal pollinators. Like the bee in Figure below , a pollinator picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly to another plant of the same species. This greatly increases the chance that fertilization will occur.             question:             What does a pollinator pick up from its body and carry directly to another plant of the same species?             options:             A. pathogen B. pollen C. spore D. seed
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what a pollinator picks up and carries to another plant, we need to examine the passage and understand the role of pollinators in plant reproduction.
1. **Contextual Understanding**: The passage discusses how wind-blown pollen might land anywhere and often gets wasted. To address this issue, plants have evolved traits to attract animal pollinators. 
2. **Role of Pollinators**: Pollinators are animals that visit flowers to collect nectar or pollen. While doing this, pollen sticks to their bodies. 
3. **Key Details**: Specifically, the passage mentions that a pollinator picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly to another plant of the same species. This action increases the chances of fertilization.
4. **Objective**: From the passage, we need to identify what exactly the pollinator carries to another plant.
Given these points, let's evaluate the options:
- A. Pathogen: This refers to organisms such as bacteria or viruses that cause disease. Pollinators are not described as carrying pathogens as part of the natural pollination process.
- B. Pollen: The passage explicitly states that pollinators pick up pollen and carry it to other plants, facilitating fertilization.
- C. Spore: Spo

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. pollen.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this problem, we should first consider what happens when an oxygen atom interacts with hydrogen ions.
1. **Understanding the Atomic Interaction**: 
   - An oxygen atom can form covalent bonds with hydrogen ions (H⁺), which are essentially protons. 
   - A single water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms (or ions) and one oxygen atom.
2. **Formation of the Compound**: 
   - When an oxygen atom picks up two hydrogen ions, it forms one molecule of water (H₂O).
3. **Identify the Correct Option**:
   - Among the given options, the correct answer is "D. water," since water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. 
Thus, when an oxygen atom picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from a solution, it forms water. So, the answer is D. water.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the information given and the roles described in the context.
1. **Role of Nuclear Reactors**: They primarily function to heat water, converting it into steam.
2. **Steam's Function**: The steam is used to drive a turbine.
3. **Purpose of Driving a Turbine**: Turbines, when driven, are generally used to generate mechanical energy. However, in the context of power plants, especially those involving nuclear reactors, turbines convert this mechanical energy into electrical energy.
Now, we match this analysis with the options provided:
- **Option A: Generation of Electricity** - This fits the context accurately as the driving of turbines by steam results in the production of electricity.
- **Option B: Absorption of Electricity** - Turbines are not involved in absorbing electricity; they are used to generate it.
- **Option C: Diffusion of Electricity** - Diffusion is not a term typically associated with what turbines achieve; instead, they generate electricity.
- **Option D: Depletion of Electricity** - Turbines do not deplete electricity; they produce it.
Therefore, the most suitable and accurate option that matches the accomplishment of driving turbines by heating water to steam is:
**A.

Q: support:             An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure below . In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure below looks familiar to you, that’s because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure above . If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works.             question:             What is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction?             options:             A. an electric generator B. a battery C. a windmill D. a diesel engine
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which device changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction, let's analyze each option:
A. An electric generator: The description provided in the support text clearly describes an electric generator as a device that converts kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. Therefore, this matches the description perfectly.
B. A battery: A battery stores and provides electrical energy through chemical reactions and does not involve kinetic energy or electromagnetic induction for generating electrical energy.
C. A windmill: A windmill converts wind energy, a form of kinetic energy, into mechanical energy but not directly into electrical energy. It requires a generator to convert mechanical energy from the wind into electrical energy.
D. A diesel engine: A diesel engine converts chemical energy from fuel into mechanical energy and does not directly generate electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:
A. an electric generator

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question about the two types of vesicle transport, let's break down each option:
1. **Epithelium and Exocytosis**: Epithelium refers to a type of tissue, not a vesicle transport mechanism. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
2. **Endocytosis and Exocytosis**: Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize substances by engulfing them in a vesicle. Exocytosis is the process by which cells expel or secrete substances in vesicles to the outside environment. These are indeed the two main types of vesicle transport in cells. Therefore, this option is correct.
3. **Eptocytosis and Exocytosis**: There is no biological process known as "eptocytosis," which makes this option incorrect.
4. **Dielectric and Exocytosis**: Dielectric refers to a material's ability to store electrical energy in an electric field, and it is not related to vesicle transport. Therefore, this option is incorrect.
Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is **B. endocytosis and exocytosis**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. endocytosis and exocytosis.

Organisms include microscopic, single-celled organisms. They also include complex, multicellular animals such as you. Clearly, life science is a huge science. That’s why a life scientist usually specializes in just one field within life science. Dr. Smith, for example, specializes in ecology. You can see the focus of ecology and several other life science fields in Table below . Click on the links provided if you want to learn about careers in these fields.             question:             What do you call a species that has died out in the past?             options:             A. extinct B. endangered C. inhabit D. remnant
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option correctly describes a species that has died out in the past, we need to understand the meanings of each choice provided:
A. Extinct: This term describes a species that no longer exists anywhere on Earth. All of its members have died out, so it is correct for describing a species that has died out in the past.
B. Endangered: This describes a species that is at risk of extinction—a species that still exists but faces threats that could lead to it becoming extinct.
C. Inhabit: This refers to living in or occupying a particular place. It does not refer to extinction.
D. Remnant: This describes a small remaining quantity of something. In the context of species, it doesn't directly reference extinction, though it might imply survivors of a population.
Considering the context of the question, the correct term for a species that has died out in the past is "extinct." Therefore, the answer is:

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the support text.
The support text states: "In plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization." This explicitly answers the question of where the embryo develops in a plant.
Looking at the options provided:
A. outside the female plant after fertilization
B. inside the female plant after fertilization
C. inside the male plant after fertilization

Q: support:             When using measuring devices, we often use a technique called calibration to increase the accuracy of our measurements. Calibration is a method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards. To better understand calibration, we will look at the example of calibrating a thermometer. All thermometers are slightly different in their temperature readings. One way to calibrate a thermometer is by using the freezing point and boiling point of water ( Figure below ). If we know that water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C, we can calibrate our thermometer by measuring the temperature of ice water and of boiling water. We place the thermometer in ice water and wait for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, then place a mark at this height which represents 0°C. Then we place the thermometer in boiling water, and after waiting for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, we place a mark at this height which represents 100°C. We can then place 100 equally spaced divisions between our 0 and 100°C marks to each represent 1°C. Our thermometer has now been calibrated using the known values for the freezing point and boiling point of water, and can be used to measure temperatures of objects between 0 and 100°C.             question:             What is the method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards called?             options:             A. distortion B. parallax C. calibration D. precision
A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking for the term used to describe the process of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards. We are provided with four options to choose from:
A. Distortion: This refers to the alteration of the original form or shape of something. It is not related to the process of setting or correcting a measuring device.
B. Parallax: This is the apparent shift in the position of an object when viewed from different angles. It doesn't relate to the process of adjusting a measuring device to known standards.
C. Calibration: As described in the given explanation, calibration is the process of adjusting a measuring device to match known measurement standards. The example given, involving a thermometer, clearly demonstrates the calibration process.
D. Precision: Precision refers to the consistency or repeatability of measurements, not the process of setting or correcting measuring devices.
Based on the explanation and definitions, the correct answer to the question is C. calibration.

Q: support:             The warm-air vent is placed near the floor of the room. Warm air is less dense than cold air so it rises. If the warm-air vent were placed near the ceiling instead, how would this affect the transfer of thermal energy throughout the room?.             question:             What property of warm air causes it to rise above cold air?             options:             A. greater pressure B. lower density C. higher temperature D. greater density
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question about what property of warm air causes it to rise above cold air, we need to consider the concepts of air density and how it relates to temperature.
1. **Density and Temperature Relationship**: Warm air is less dense than cold air. When air is heated, its molecules move more vigorously, which causes the air to expand, leading to a decrease in density.
2. **Floating Effect**: In fluids (liquids and gases), less dense substances rise above denser ones. This is because the less dense warm air is pushed upwards by the more dense cold air, which stays closer to the ground due to gravity. 
3. **Warm Air Rising**: This phenomenon is a natural consequence of buoyancy forces acting on the less dense warm air, causing it to rise above the colder, denser air.
Now, looking at the options given:
- A. Greater pressure: This does not directly cause warm air to rise above cold air, as pressure differences more commonly lead to movement across horizontal planes rather than vertical rising.
- B. Lower density: Correct. It is the lower density of the warm air in comparison to the cold air that causes the warm air to rise.
- C. Higher temperature: While warm air indeed has a higher

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. lower density

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to determine the unit of measurement that represents the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute. According to the information provided in the support:
1. Power may be measured in a unit called the horsepower.
2. One horsepower is defined as the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute.
3. One horsepower equals 745 watts of power.

- Option A: Joule - The joule is a unit of energy, not a unit of power. Therefore, it does not represent the amount of work done per unit of time such as in 1 minute.
- Option B: Torque - Torque is related to the rotational force applied to an object. It is not a unit of power and does not measure the amount of work done by a horse in 1 minute.
- Option C: Horsepower - The information provided defines one horsepower as the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute, which directly answers the question.
- Option D: Watt - While a watt is a unit of power, the specific amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute is defined in terms of horsepower, not just any wattage value.

Fluid in the cavity supports and stiffens the cnidarian body.             question:             What organism is characterized by an incomplete digestive system and a single, tentacled opening?             options:             A. sponges B. annelids C. prokaryotes D. cnidarians
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the organism characterized by an incomplete digestive system and a single, tentacled opening, we should examine the features described for each option:
A. Sponges: Sponges have a porous body with multiple openings and do not have a traditional digestive system. They use a system of channels and specialized cells to filter and absorb nutrients. Thus, sponges do not match the description of having an incomplete digestive system with a single opening.
B. Annelids: Annelids are a group of worms, such as earthworms, which typically have a complete digestive system with a separate mouth and anus. This does not match the description of having one single opening for digestion.
C. Prokaryotes: Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms without a defined digestive system. This choice does not match the description of having a digestive cavity with an opening surrounded by tentacles.
D. Cnidarians: Cnidarians, such as jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones, have a simple digestive system characterized by a single opening, serving as both mouth and anus, called a gastrovascular cavity. This opening is surrounded by tentacles containing specialized cells called nematocysts, used for capturing prey.

Thus a motorcycle battery and a car battery can both have the same voltage (more precisely, the same potential difference between battery terminals), yet one stores much more energy than the other since ΔPE = qΔV . The car battery can move more charge than the motorcycle battery, although both are 12 V batteries.             question:             What term is not the same as energy, but means the energy per unit charge?             options:             A. frequency B. speed C. voltage D. mass
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to analyze the given information about voltage and energy. 
The prompt explains that voltage is the energy per unit charge. This directly answers the question, as we must find the term that is not the same as energy but represents energy per unit charge.
We have these options to choose from:
A. frequency

B. Speed - This term also does not relate to energy per unit charge. Speed is a measure of how fast an object moves, typically expressed in units of distance per time.
C. Voltage - The prompt defines voltage as the energy per unit charge, specifically describing it as not the same as energy because it's per unit of charge.
D. Mass - This is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and doesn't relate to energy per unit charge.
Clearly, the answer according to the given information is C. voltage, as it is defined in the context as energy per unit charge.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. voltage

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which part of the African violet is used to propagate other plants, we need to consider the methods of propagation commonly used for this species.
1. **Petals (Option A)**: Petals are usually not used for plant propagation. They are primarily decorative and do not contain the necessary cells or structures for creating new plants.
2. **Roots (Option B)**: Although some plants can be propagated via root division, African violets are not typically propagated this way. Division of the root system is less common for them compared to other methods.
3. **Spores (Option C)**: Spores are typically associated with the reproduction of ferns, mosses, and fungi. African violets reproduce through vegetative means, not through spores.
4. **Leaves (Option D)**: The most common method of propagating African violets is through leaf cuttings. A healthy leaf is clipped from the plant, which is then placed in soil or water to encourage new roots and plantlets to grow.
Therefore, the specific part of the African violet used to propagate other plants is the **leaves (Option D)**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. leaves

A: Let's think step by step.
To find the answer, let's consider the role of fibers and aerobic respiration:
1. **Understanding Aerobic Respiration**: Aerobic respiration is a process that requires oxygen to produce energy (ATP) from nutrients. It is an efficient way to generate energy and is used by certain types of muscle fibers.
2. **Types of Muscle Fibers**: Muscle fibers can broadly be categorized based on their energy metabolism:
   - **Fast-twitch fibers**: These are designed for short bursts of power and speed and largely rely on anaerobic respiration (which does not require oxygen).
   - **Slow-twitch fibers**: These are designed for endurance and sustained activities. They primarily rely on aerobic respiration.
3. **Correct Terminology**: Slow-twitch fibers, which rely on aerobic respiration, are often called "oxidative fibers." This is because they use oxygen in the process of metabolism.
4. **Answer Choices**: Let's match this understanding with the given options:
   - A. evaporative fibers: Not a recognized term in this context.
   - B. fragile fibers: Not relevant to respiration type.
   - C. hydrogen fibers: Does not pertain to muscle fibers and respiration.
   - D. oxidative fibers: Matches the description of fibers using aerobic

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. oxidative fibers

Q: support:             The energy of electromagnetic waves depends on their frequency. Low-frequency waves have little energy and are normally harmless. High-frequency waves have a lot of energy and are potentially very harmful.             question:             Which form of electromagnetic waves have more energy: low frequency wave or high frequency waves?             options:             A. low frequency waves B. high frequency waves C. neither D. the same
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which form of electromagnetic waves has more energy, we need to consider the relationship between frequency and energy in electromagnetic waves. 
1. **Understanding Frequency and Energy Relationship**: The energy of electromagnetic waves is directly proportional to their frequency. This means that as the frequency of a wave increases, its energy also increases. Conversely, as the frequency decreases, the energy decreases.
2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **Option A: Low frequency waves** - Since low-frequency waves have lower energy, they do not fit the description of having more energy.
   - **Option B: High frequency waves** - High-frequency waves have higher energy, which fits the description of having more energy.
   - **Option C: Neither** - This implies that neither low nor high frequency waves have more energy, which is incorrect because we know frequency directly correlates with energy.
   - **Option D: The same** - This suggests that energy is identical regardless of frequency, which contradicts the principle that energy is dependent on frequency.
3. **Conclusion**: High-frequency waves have more energy compared to low-frequency waves.
Therefore, the correct answer is **B. high frequency waves**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. high frequency waves

A cell has structure, but so does a crystal. Biologists define life by listing characteristics that living things share. Something that has all of the characteristics of life is considered to be alive. The duck decoy in Figure below may look like a duck, act like a duck in that it floats about, but it is not alive. The decoy cannot reproduce, respond to its environment, or breathe.             question:             Something that has all of the characteristics of life is considered to be what?             options:             A. ecosystem B. molecule C. alive D. organism
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify what "something that has all of the characteristics of life" is considered to be according to the information provided.
1. **Understanding the Context**: The passage explains that living things are defined by certain characteristics shared among them. It uses examples to differentiate living from non-living things and mentions that something with all characteristics of life is considered to be alive.
2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - A. **Ecosystem**: An ecosystem consists of both living and non-living components, so it doesn't fit the description of having all characteristics of life.
   - B. **Molecule**: A molecule is a chemical structure and not considered alive or having life characteristics.
   - C. **Alive**: This directly relates to the definition given—something that has all characteristics of life is considered alive.
   - D. **Organism**: An organism is a living entity with all characteristics of life, making it a strong candidate; however, in the context of the specific wording of the question, "alive" is the more directly applicable term.
3. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided passage and the explanation of characteristics that define something as having life, the correct choice is C. alive.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. alive.

Those letters actually represent alleles. Unlike other traits, your blood type has three alleles, instead of two!.             question:             What do the letters in our blood types represent?             options:             A. alleles B. proteins C. iron levels D. genomes
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the letters in our blood types represent, let's consider the context provided in the question. The passage mentions that blood type shows codominance and that the letters A, O, AB represent alleles, and it points out that blood type involves three alleles instead of the usual two for other traits.
Given this information:
- The letters A, B, AB, and O in blood types refer to specific genetic variations that are involved in determining an individual's blood type.
- These variations are directly described in the passage as alleles, which are different forms of a gene found at the same place on a chromosome.
With this understanding, the letters in blood types represent alleles.
Therefore, the correct option is:
**A. alleles**

Q: support:             There are three main ocean zones based on distance from shore. They are the intertidal zone , neritic zone , and oceanic zone . Distance from shore influences how many nutrients are in the water. Why? Most nutrients are washed into ocean water from land. Therefore, water closer to shore tends to have more nutrients. Living things need nutrients. So distance from shore also influences how many organisms live in the water.             question:             What do living things need to survive?             options:             A. nutrients B. oxygen C. molecules D. heat
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what living things need to survive, based on the passage, let's break it down:
1. The passage discusses how nutrients influence the number of organisms that live in different ocean zones.
2. It specifically states that most nutrients are washed into ocean water from land and that water closer to shore has more nutrients.
3. It emphasizes that living things need nutrients, linking the number of organisms to nutrient availability.
Therefore, based on the passage, the key factor mentioned that living things need to survive is nutrients.
Now, looking at the options:
A. nutrients - This is explicitly mentioned in the passage as something living things need.
B. oxygen - While important, it is not mentioned in this passage.
C. molecules - This is a broad term and not specified in the passage.
D. heat - Not mentioned in the context of this passage.
Considering the passage focuses on nutrients as essential for the survival of living things, the correct answer is:
A. nutrients

Each orbital has a maximum of just two electrons. Different energy levels in the cloud have different numbers of orbitals. Therefore, different energy levels have different maximum numbers of electrons. Table below lists the number of orbitals and electrons for the first four energy levels. Energy levels farther from the nucleus have more orbitals. Therefore, these levels can hold more electrons.             question:             The denser regions of the electron cloud are called what?             options:             A. lattices B. orbitals C. isotopes D. cores
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the answer, let's break down the information given:
1. **Denser Regions of the Electron Cloud:** The text mentions that some regions of the electron cloud are denser than others and that these regions are where electrons are most likely to be found.
2. **Terminology:** It states that these denser regions are called "orbitals."
3. **Answer Choices Analysis:**
   - A. Lattices: This term is generally used in the context of solid structures and crystallography, not electron clouds.
   - B. Orbitals: This matches the explanation given in the text as the term used for the denser regions of the electron cloud.
   - C. Isotopes: This refers to different forms of the same element with a different number of neutrons, unrelated to the electron cloud density.

Q: support:             6.3 The Laws of Thermodynamics In studying energy, scientists use the term “system” to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers. Everything outside of the system is called the surroundings. Single cells are biological systems. Systems can be thought of as having a certain amount of order. It takes energy to make a system more ordered. The more ordered a system is, the lower its entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. As a system becomes more disordered, the lower its energy and the higher its entropy become. A series of laws, called the laws of thermodynamics, describe the properties and processes of energy transfer. The first law states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. This means that energy can’t be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. The second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy, resulting in a more disordered system. In other words, no energy transfer is completely efficient and tends toward disorder.             question:             In studying energy, what term do scientists use to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers?             options:             A. ecosystem B. molecule C. system D. world
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to refer to the given information in the context of studying energy. According to the provided text, scientists use the term “system” to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers. 
Let's evaluate each option:
A. ecosystem - This term generally refers to a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment, but in the context of energy transfers as mentioned in the text, this is not the term used by scientists.
B. molecule - This term specifically refers to a group of atoms bonded together and doesn’t relate to the whole environment and matter involved in energy transfers.
C. system - As stated in the text, this is the term used by scientists to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers.
D. world - This term refers to the Earth or the global environment as a whole and is not specific to the context of energy transfers mentioned in the text.
Therefore, the correct answer is C. system.

Q: support:             (a) Initially, the system (a copper penny and concentrated nitric acid) is at atmospheric pressure. (b) When the penny is added to the nitric acid, the volume of NO2 gas that is formed causes the piston to move upward to maintain the system at atmospheric pressure. In doing so, the system is performing work on its surroundings. The symbol E in represents the internal energy of a system, which is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of all its components. It is the change in internal energy that produces heat plus work. To measure the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions, chemists usually use a related thermodynamic quantity calledenthalpy (H) (from the Greek enthalpein, meaning “to warm”). The enthalpy of a system is defined as the sum of its internal energy E plus the product of its pressure Pand volume V:.             question:             To measure what changes that occur in chemical reactions, chemists usually use a related thermodynamic quantity, calledenthalpy?             options:             A. entropy B. energy C. evaporation D. ion exchange

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which state prevents a system from spontaneously changing and thereby prohibits it from doing work, we must consider concepts from thermodynamics and physics.
1. **Understanding the States**:
   - **Equality**: In general terms, equality means sameness or uniformity. It is not typically used to describe a system’s state in physics.
   - **Balance**: This suggests an equal distribution of forces but is not a standard term used to describe systems where no spontaneous change can occur.
   - **Stability**: This refers to a state where a system tends to return to equilibrium after a disturbance. While stability means resistance to change, it doesn't mean no change can ever take place.
   - **Equilibrium**: In thermodynamics, equilibrium refers to a state where there are no net macroscopic flows of matter or energy. No spontaneous changes will occur in this state; therefore, no work can potentially be done.
2. **Evaluating The Options**:
   - Systems in a state of equilibrium experience no net change because inward and outward forces are balanced. This state implies that no net work can be performed because spontaneous changes are not occurring.
   - "Equality" and "balance" do not directly imply a lack of spontaneity as the requirement for no work

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. equilibrium

Q: support:             Some predator species are known as keystone species. A keystone species is one that plays an especially important role in its community. Major changes in the numbers of a keystone species affect the populations of many other species in the community. For example, some sea star species are keystone species in coral reef communities. The sea stars prey on mussels and sea urchins, which have no other natural predators. If sea stars were removed from a coral reef community, mussel and sea urchin populations would have explosive growth. This, in turn, would drive out most other species. In the end, the coral reef community would be destroyed.             question:             What is a species that plays an especially important role in it's community called?             options:             A. keystone B. Invasive C. complement D. Leader
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the concept being described in the scenario. 
1. **Definition**: The passage explains that a keystone species is one that plays an especially important role in its community. If the numbers of a keystone species change significantly, it impacts many other species within the same environment.
2. **Example**: The passage provides an example of sea star species being a keystone species in coral reef communities. Their role in preying on mussels and sea urchins helps to maintain the ecological balance.
3. **Effects of Removal**: If sea stars, the keystone species, are removed, the passage states that mussel and sea urchin populations would grow unchecked. This imbalance could ultimately lead to the destruction of the coral reef community.
Now, let's evaluate the options provided:
- **A. Keystone**: The passage explicitly mentions that a species playing an especially important role in its community is called a "keystone" species.
- **B. Invasive**: An invasive species is typically one that is non-native to the ecosystem and often has negative effects on its new environment.
- **C. Complement**: This term doesn't accurately describe a species with a crucial ecological role as explained in the passage.

The formula for population growth rate is:.             question:             What term that shows how fast a population is growing includes new members added to the population over a given period, as well as old members removed from the population?             options:             A. growth rate B. birth rate C. population density D. emigration
A: Let's think step by step.
To address the question, we need to identify which term represents the rate at which a population grows, considering both new members added and old members removed from the population.
1. **Understanding the Options:**
   - **A. Growth Rate:** This term directly relates to how fast a population is growing, including both additions (births and immigration) and subtractions (deaths and emigration).
   - **B. Birth Rate:** This specifically refers to the number of births in a population, not accounting for deaths or emigration.
   - **C. Population Density:** This relates to the number of individuals within a certain area or volume, not directly to growth rate.
   - **D. Emigration:** This refers to the movement of individuals out of a population, contributing to decreases in population size, but doesn't encompass the whole growth rate.
2. **Given Definition:**
   - The concept we're looking for should account for both new members being added and old members being removed. The description in the support text explains that "growth rate equals the number of new members added to the population in a year for each 100 members already in the population," which includes the balance of births (additions) and deaths (removals).

The simplest class of organic compounds is the hydrocarbons, which consist entirely of carbon and hydrogen. Petroleum and natural gas are complex, naturally occurring mixtures of many different hydrocarbons that furnish raw materials for the chemical industry. The four major classes of hydrocarbons are the alkanes, which contain only carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon single bonds; the alkenes, which contain at least one carbon–carbon double bond; the alkynes, which contain at least one carbon–carbon triple bond; and the aromatic hydrocarbons, which usually contain rings of six carbon atoms that can be drawn with alternating single and double bonds. Alkanes are also called saturated hydrocarbons, whereas hydrocarbons that contain multiple bonds (alkenes, alkynes, and aromatics) are unsaturated.             question:             The simplest class of organic compounds is the what?             options:             A.

Q: support:             The trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity. As with the previously discussed nerve tracts, the sensory pathways of the trigeminal pathway each involve three successive neurons. First, axons from the trigeminal ganglion enter the brain stem at the level of the pons. These axons project to one of three locations. The spinal trigeminal nucleus of the medulla receives information similar to that carried by spinothalamic tract, such as pain and temperature sensations. Other axons go to either the chief sensory nucleus in the pons or the mesencephalic nuclei in the midbrain. These nuclei receive information like that carried by the dorsal column system, such as touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception. Axons from the second neuron decussate and ascend to the thalamus along the trigeminothalamic tract. In the thalamus, each axon synapses with the third neuron in its respective pathway. Axons from the third neuron then project from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex of the cerebrum. The sensory pathway for gustation travels along the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, which synapse with neurons of the solitary nucleus in the brain stem. Axons from the solitary nucleus then project to the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus. Finally, axons from the ventral posterior nucleus project to the gustatory cortex of the cerebral cortex, where taste is processed and consciously perceived. The sensory pathway for audition travels along the vestibulocochlear nerve, which synapses with neurons in the cochlear nuclei of the superior medulla. Within the brain stem, input from either ear is combined to extract location information from the auditory stimuli. Whereas the initial auditory stimuli received at the cochlea strictly represent the frequency—or pitch—of the stimuli, the locations of sounds can be determined by comparing information arriving at both ears.             question:             Which pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity?             options:             A. cranial pathway B. trigeminal pathway C. posterior pathway D. dual pathway
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks about the pathway that carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity. 
From the provided text, it is clear that:
- The trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity.
The other options given in the question do not match the descriptions in the text:
- There is no mention of a "cranial pathway" that carries such information.
- The "posterior pathway" and "dual pathway" are also not mentioned in the context of carrying somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. trigeminal pathway

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. trigeminal pathway

Q: support:             The story is quite different for gases. Gases take the shape of their container, and they are relatively easy to compress. There are fewer gas particles per unit volume than for the same substance in the liquid or solid form. In fact, the liquid form of a given material is generally several hundred times more dense than the gas form at normal pressures. Despite the large amounts of empty space, a sample of a gas contains many particles moving around, colliding and imparting force on their surroundings. For example, in a one mole sample of gas at 0°C and 1 atm of pressure, each cubic centimeter contains roughly 2.7 × 10 19 molecules. Each molecule participates in several billion collisions every second, moving only about 10-100 nanometers between collisions. Additionally, these gas particles move at very high speeds. For example, at 25°C, the average speed of hydrogen molecules in a sample of hydrogen gas is 1960 m/s.             question:             What take the shape of their container, and are relatively easy to compress?             options:             A. fluids B. semi-fluids C. gases D. molecules

A: Let's think step by step.
Bone marrow cells are ideal for gene therapy due to their ability to reproduce over a person's lifetime. This property allows for the continued production of healthy cells after the gene therapy has been administered. Here's a breakdown of the options:
A. Matching: While matching (such as HLA matching) is important for transplants to prevent rejection, it is not the primary reason bone marrow cells are ideal for gene therapy.
B. Irreversible reproduction: This option doesn't accurately describe bone marrow cells. Bone marrow cells continually renew themselves rather than being involved in one-time, irreversible reproduction.
C. Lifelong reproduction: This is the correct answer. Bone marrow cells have the capacity for lifelong reproduction, which means they can continue to divide and create new blood cells indefinitely. This continuous ability to reproduce makes them particularly suitable for gene therapy because therapeutic genes introduced into these cells can be perpetuated and spread throughout the body over time.
D. Behavior reproduction: This term doesn't accurately apply to gene therapy or the properties of bone marrow cells.
Thus, the answer is C. lifelong reproduction.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. lifelong reproduction.

A more serious problem is the genetic disease galactosemia, which results from the absence of an enzyme needed to convert galactose to glucose. Certain bacteria can metabolize lactose, forming lactic acid as one of the products. This reaction is responsible for the “souring” of milk.             question:             Many adults and some children suffer from a deficiency of lactase. these individuals are said to be lactose intolerant because they cannot digest the lactose found in what?             options:             A. peanuts B. milk C. fruit D. meat
A: Let's think step by step.
Lactose intolerance is a condition where individuals cannot properly digest lactose due to a deficiency of the enzyme lactase. Lactose is a sugar that is primarily found in milk and dairy products. The support information explicitly states that lactose is found in milk, which corresponds to the primary source of lactose that lactose intolerant individuals have trouble digesting.
Given the options:
A. peanuts - Peanuts do not contain lactose.
B. milk - Milk contains lactose, which is the sugar that lactose intolerant individuals cannot digest.
C. fruit - Fruit does not naturally contain lactose.

You can learn more about electric safety features in the home by watching the video at this URL: http://www. dailymotion. com/video/x6fg5i_basics-of-your-home-s-electrical-sy_school .             question:             Three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and gfci outlets are safety features that recognize the danger of what?             options:             A. heat B. magnetism C. gravity D. electricity
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets provide safety protection against, let's examine each component:
1. **Three-prong plugs**: These are designed to provide a grounding pathway. The third prong is the ground, which helps in preventing electric shock by directing any excess electricity safely into the ground instead of through a person's body.
2. **Circuit breakers**: They are designed to protect electrical circuits from damage caused by overload or a short circuit. When too much current flows, the circuit breaker trips and stops the electrical flow to prevent overheating and potential fire hazards.
3. **GFCI outlets**: These are specifically built to protect against electric shocks, especially in areas where water is present. They quickly cut off the electricity supply if they detect any imbalance between outgoing and incoming current, which might indicate a leakage current flowing through a person.
All these devices are specifically protecting against the dangers posed by **electricity**, such as electric shocks and electrical fires. Therefore, the answer is:
D. electricity

Q: support:             Catabolic Reactions Catabolic reactions break down large organic molecules into smaller molecules, releasing the energy contained in the chemical bonds. These energy releases (conversions) are not 100 percent efficient. The amount of energy released is less than the total amount contained in the molecule. Approximately 40 percent of energy yielded from catabolic reactions is directly transferred to the high-energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP, the energy currency of cells, can be used immediately to power molecular machines that support cell, tissue, and organ function. This includes building new tissue and repairing damaged tissue. ATP can also be stored to fulfill future energy demands. The remaining 60 percent of the energy released from catabolic reactions is given off as heat, which tissues and body fluids absorb. Structurally, ATP molecules consist of an adenine, a ribose, and three phosphate groups (Figure 24.2). The chemical bond between the second and third phosphate groups, termed a high-energy bond, represents the greatest source of energy in a cell. It is the first bond that catabolic enzymes break when cells require energy to do work. The products of this reaction are a molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a lone phosphate group (Pi). ATP, ADP, and Pi are constantly being cycled through reactions that build ATP and store energy, and reactions that break down ATP and release energy.             question:             Catabolic reactions break down large organic molecules into smaller molecules, releasing the energy contained in what?             options:             A. molecular bonds B. crystals bonds C. chemical bonds D. liquid bonds
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's consider the provided information:
1. Catabolic reactions involve the breakdown of large organic molecules into smaller ones.
2. During this process, energy that is contained in the bonds of these molecules is released.
3. The question asks about the type of bonds from which the energy is released.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: Molecular bonds – This is a vague term and not commonly used in this context.
- Option B: Crystals bonds – This is not relevant to the description provided, as crystal bonds are related to solid crystal structures and not typically involved in catabolic reactions of organic molecules.

The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the air. This creates greater greenhouse effect and global warming.             question:             While climate change in earth history was due to natural processes, what is primarily to blame for recent global warming?             options:             A. wars B. volcanos C. factories D. human actions
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what is primarily to blame for recent global warming, we need to analyze the provided text:
1. The statement begins with acknowledging that climate change in Earth's history was attributed to natural processes. This highlights that in the past, natural factors such as volcanic activity or changes in the Earth's orbit contributed to climate variations.
2. The text continues to state that recent global warming is mainly due to human actions.
3. It specifically mentions that the burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming.
Now, we evaluate the given options:
A. Wars - While wars can have environmental impacts, they are not the primary cause of recent global warming.
B. Volcanos - While volcanic activity is a natural process that can affect the climate, the text emphasizes human actions as the primary cause of recent global warming, not natural processes.
C. Factories - Factories are associated with industrial activities that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, the term "human actions" encompasses a broader range of activities, including those not directly linked to factories.
D. Human actions - This option is directly mentioned in the statement as the primary cause of recent global warming, particularly through actions like burning fossil fuels.
Based on the analysis, the correct answer

Q: support:             Gravity keeps the Moon orbiting Earth. Gravity keeps the planets orbiting the Sun.             question:             What keeps the moon orbiting earth?             options:             A. axial tilt B. gravity C. the Sun D. Coriolis effect
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what keeps the Moon orbiting Earth, we need to analyze the information provided:
1. The support statement tells us that "Gravity keeps the Moon orbiting Earth."
2. We also know that gravity is a fundamental force that attracts two bodies towards each other.
3. From this, it's clear that gravity is the force responsible for keeping celestial bodies in orbit around one another.
Given this understanding, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: Axial tilt - This refers to the angle at which a planet or moon's rotational axis is tilted in relation to its orbital plane. Axial tilt affects the seasons and climate but not the force that keeps the Moon in orbit.
  
- Option B: Gravity - As stated in the support, gravity is indeed the force that keeps the Moon orbiting Earth.
  
- Option C: The Sun - While the Sun's gravitational influence affects the entire solar system, it is not the primary force keeping the Moon in orbit around Earth.
  
- Option D: Coriolis effect - This is an inertial force that acts on objects in motion relative to a rotating frame of reference, affecting weather patterns and ocean currents on Earth but not the Moon's orbit.
Considering these points, the correct answer is:
**B. gravity**

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. gravity

Q: support:             Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege. org/l/transgenic) explaining how scientists create a transgenic animal. Although the classic methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: "What does this gene or DNA element do?" This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classical genetic methodology. One example of this method is analogous to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the wing’s function is flight. The classic genetic method compares insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observes that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly in a reverse genetics approach, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. Alternately, reverse genetics can be used to cause a gene to overexpress itself to determine what phenotypic effects may occur.             question:             Which kind of genetics approach involves mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function?             options:             A. possible genetics B. reverse genetics C. impossible genetics D. inverse genetics
A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking about the type of genetics approach that involves mutating or deleting genes to find out clues about the gene's function.
1. **Understanding the Context**: The passage discusses how modern techniques in genetics start at the DNA sequence level and explore what a specific gene or DNA element does. The technique described as doing this is reverse genetics.
2. **Explanation in Passage**: The passage states that reverse genetics involves altering the genetic makeup, such as mutating or deleting genes, to understand their function. This method contrasts with classical genetics, which starts with the phenotype and works backward to identify the gene.
3. **Options Analysis**:
   - A. possible genetics: This term does not relate to any known genetics approach.
   - B. reverse genetics: As described, this involves changing genes to study their functions.
   - C. impossible genetics: Like option A, this is not a recognized approach in genetics.
   - D. inverse genetics: Similar to options A and C, this term is not applicable or recognized in the context provided.
4. **Conclusion**: The correct term for the genetics approach that involves mutating or deleting genes to understand gene function is reverse genetics.
Therefore, the answer is B. reverse genetics.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. reverse genetics.

There may be more than 10 million insect species in the world, although most of them have not yet been identified. In terms of their numbers and diversity, insects clearly are the dominant animals in the world.             question:             More than half of all known organisms are what?             options:             A. enzymes B. insects C. mammals D. spiders
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to determine what the statement in the "support" section is saying about the majority of known organisms.
1. The prompt begins by mentioning arthropods, particularly insects, which belong to Class Insecta. It emphasizes that within arthropods, insects are predominant.
2. The next part of the support mentions that more than half of all known organisms are insects.
3. Finally, the support emphasizes the numerical dominance and diversity of insects globally.
Given these points, let's examine the options:
- **Option A: enzymes** - This is incorrect because the support statement is specifically about organisms, not proteins or biological catalysts like enzymes.
  
- **Option B: insects** - This is directly aligned with the support statement, which clearly mentions that more than half of known organisms are insects.
- **Option C: mammals** - This is incorrect because mammals make up a much smaller proportion of the total number of known organisms compared to insects.
- **Option D: spiders** - While spiders are arthropods, they are not cited as comprising more than half of known organisms, as the focus of the support is on insects.
Therefore, the correct answer is B. insects.

Q: support:             Obesity With obesity at high rates in the United States, there is a public health focus on reducing obesity and associated health risks, which include diabetes, colon and breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease. How does the food consumed contribute to obesity? Fatty foods are calorie-dense, meaning that they have more calories per unit mass than carbohydrates or proteins. One gram of carbohydrates has four calories, one gram of protein has four calories, and one gram of fat has nine calories. Animals tend to seek lipid-rich food for their higher energy content. Greater amounts of food energy taken in than the body’s requirements will result in storage of the excess in fat deposits. Excess carbohydrate is used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. When glycogen stores are full, additional glucose is converted into fatty acids. These fatty acids are stored in adipose tissue cells—the fat cells in the mammalian body whose primary role is to store fat for later use. The rate of obesity among children is rapidly rising in the United States. To combat childhood obesity and ensure that children get a healthy start in life, in 2010 First Lady Michelle Obama launched the Let’s Move! campaign. The goal of this campaign is to educate parents and caregivers on providing healthy nutrition and encouraging active lifestyles in future generations. This program aims to involve the entire community, including parents, teachers, and healthcare providers to ensure that children have access to healthy foods—more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains—and consume fewer calories from processed foods. Another goal is to ensure that children get physical activity. With the increase in television viewing and stationary pursuits such as video games, sedentary lifestyles have become the norm. Visit www. letsmove. gov to learn more.             question:             For what purpose does liver use the excess carbohydrate?             options:             A. dilute carbohydrates B. convert starches C. to synthesize glycogen D. process sugar
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to understand the role of the liver in carbohydrate metabolism as described in the text.
1. The passage discusses how the liver processes excess carbohydrates.
2. According to the passage, excess carbohydrates are used by the liver for a specific purpose.
3. The passage states: "Excess carbohydrate is used by the liver to synthesize glycogen."
Now, let's match this with the given options:
A. dilute carbohydrates - This is not mentioned in the text as a function of the liver.
B. convert starches - This is not relevant to the passage's description of liver function regarding carbohydrates.
C. to synthesize glycogen - This directly matches the information in the passage.
D. process sugar - While the liver does process sugars, the passage specifically mentions glycogen synthesis.
So, the correct answer is:
C. to synthesize glycogen.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. to synthesize glycogen.

Q: support:             Alkenes Organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms are described as unsaturated. You have likely heard of unsaturated fats. These are complex organic molecules with long chains of carbon atoms, which contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. Unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules that contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Carbon atoms linked by a double bond are bound together by two bonds, one σ bond and one π bond. Double and triple bonds give rise to a different geometry around the carbon atom that participates in them, leading to important differences in molecular shape and properties. The differing geometries are responsible for the different properties of unsaturated versus saturated fats. Ethene, C2H4, is the simplest alkene. Each carbon atom in ethene, commonly called ethylene, has a trigonal planar structure. The second member of the series is propene (propylene) (Figure 20.7); the butene isomers follow in the series. Four carbon atoms in the chain of butene allows for the formation of isomers based on the position of the double bond, as well as a new form of isomerism.             question:             What are alkenes organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms described as?             options:             A. saturated B. insulated C. unsaturated D. strong
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to identify how alkenes are described. The text states, "Organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms are described as unsaturated." 
From the given options:
A. Saturated - This is incorrect, as saturated compounds do not contain double or triple bonds.
B. Insulated - This is not related to the chemical description of bonds in organic compounds.
C. Unsaturated - This is correct. The text explicitly states that compounds with double or triple bonds are unsaturated.
D. Strong - This is not related to the description of compounds with double or triple bonds.
Thus, alkenes are described as unsaturated. The correct answer is:
C. Unsaturated

Q: support:             The two materials do have at least one thing in common. The atoms in the materials are held together by covalent bonds. These bonds consist of electrons shared between two or more atoms. Unlike ionic bonds, where electrons are either lost or gained by an atom to form charged ions, electrons in covalent compounds are shared between the two atoms, giving rise to properties that are quite different from those seen in ionic materials.             question:             Electrons in covalent compounds are shared between the two atoms, unlike the case in what type of bonds?             options:             A. soluble bonds B. horizontal bonds C. ionic bonds D. weak bonds
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we must first understand the difference between covalent and other types of bonds based on the given information.
1. **Covalent Bonds**: The passage states that in covalent bonds, electrons are shared between two or more atoms. This sharing of electrons results in distinct properties for covalent compounds.
2. **Distinction from Ionic Bonds**: According to the passage, in ionic bonds, electrons are not shared. Instead, they are either lost or gained by an atom to form charged ions. This is a clear distinction compared to covalent bonds where electrons are shared.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **A. Soluble bonds**: The term "soluble bonds" does not specifically refer to a type of bond in contrast with covalent bonds. Solubility is a property that describes how substances dissolve.
  
- **B. Horizontal bonds**: This term does not represent a recognized type of chemical bond. 
  
- **C. Ionic bonds**: Based on the information provided, this option best contrasts with covalent bonds, as electrons are transferred and not shared in ionic bonds.
- **D. Weak bonds**: This is more of a general characteristic rather than a specific type of bond. It does not convey the particular

Q: support:             Viscosity (η) is the resistance of a liquid to flow. Some liquids, such as gasoline, ethanol, and water, flow very readily and hence have a low viscosity. Others, such as motor oil, molasses, and maple syrup, flow very slowly and have a high viscosity. The two most common methods for evaluating the viscosity of a liquid are (1) to measure the time it takes for a quantity of liquid to flow through a narrow vertical tube and (2) to measure the time it takes steel balls to fall through a given volume of the liquid. The higher the viscosity, the slower the liquid flows through the tube and the steel balls fall. Viscosity is expressed in units of the poise (mPa·s); the higher the number, the higher the viscosity. The viscosities of some representative liquids are listed in Table 11.4 "Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25°C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids" and show a correlation between viscosity and intermolecular forces. Because a liquid can flow only if the molecules can move past one another with minimal resistance, strong intermolecular attractive forces make it more difficult for molecules to move with respect to one another. The addition of a second hydroxyl group to ethanol, for example, which produces ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH), increases the viscosity 15-fold. This effect is due to the increased number of hydrogen bonds that can form between hydroxyl groups in adjacent molecules, resulting in dramatically stronger intermolecular attractive forces.             question:             What is the resistance of a liquid to flow called?             options:             A. viscosity B. turbulence C. elasticity D. permeability
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to identify which term refers to the resistance of a liquid to flow. The passage provided gives us important information regarding the behavior of liquids and their flow:
1. The passage states: "Viscosity (η) is the resistance of a liquid to flow." This explicitly defines viscosity as the property related to resistance to flow.
2. The other options, such as turbulence, elasticity, and permeability, do not fit this definition.
   - Turbulence refers to chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity, often related to fluid dynamics but not specific to the resistance to flow.
   - Elasticity pertains to the ability of a material to return to its original shape after deformation, which is more relevant to solids rather than liquids.
   - Permeability relates to the ability of a material to allow fluids to pass through it, which is not directly about resistance to flow within the liquid itself.
Thus, based on the definition provided in the passage, the resistance of a liquid to flow is called "viscosity." Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. viscosity

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. viscosity

To determine which option correctly completes the question, let's break down the information provided:
1. We know that atoms have a mass largely based on the number of protons and neutrons.
2. These protons and neutrons are found in a specific part of the atom.
Now let's consider the question: "The mass of atoms is based on the number of protons and neutrons in what?"
- Option A: molecules - Molecules are made up of atoms, not a part of atoms, so this is incorrect.
- Option B: components - This is too vague and not a specific part of an atom, so this is incorrect.
- Option C: nucleus - The nucleus is the central part of an atom where protons and neutrons are located. This fits perfectly with the information given.
- Option D: electrons - Electrons are subatomic particles located in the electron cloud around the nucleus and do not primarily contribute to the mass of atoms.
Therefore, the correct answer is C. nucleus.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to determine where the muscles that position the pectoral girdle are located. According to the provided text, these muscles are situated either on the "anterior thorax" or on the "posterior thorax." 
Now, let's look at the options given:
A. analogous thorax  
B. inferred thorax  
C. posterior thorax  
D. posterior thorax  
The text mentions "posterior thorax" as the location for these muscles, and this matches options C and D. Though both options are the same, they accurately capture the location mentioned in the text.
Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:
C. posterior thorax

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. posterior thorax

Figure below shows how the seeds of gymnosperms and angiosperms differ. Do you see the main difference between the two seeds? The angiosperm seed is surrounded by an ovary .             question:             What are the two major types of seed plants called?             options:             A. flowers and fruits B. perennials and annuals C. deciduous and evergreen D. gymnosperms and angiosperms
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the two major types of seed plants, we can refer to the provided support statement. It states: "The two major types of seed plants are the gymnosperms (seeds in cones) and angiosperms (seeds in ovaries of flowers)." This information clearly indicates that the two major types of seed plants are gymnosperms and angiosperms.
Now, let's evaluate the options given in the question:
A. flowers and fruits - This is incorrect, as flowers and fruits are not classifications of seed plants.
B. perennials and annuals - This is incorrect, as perennials and annuals refer to the lifespan of plants, not the classification of seed plants.
C. deciduous and evergreen - This is incorrect, as deciduous and evergreen refer to the types of trees based on their leaf-shedding habits, not seed plant classification.
D. gymnosperms and angiosperms - This is correct, as per the support statement.
Therefore, the answer is D: gymnosperms and angiosperms.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. gymnosperms and angiosperms.

Q: support:             A car’s gas pedal, like the one in Figure below , is sometimes called the accelerator. That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force.             question:             What is the measure of the change in the velocity of a moving object called?             options:             A. compression B. transmission C. pressurization D. acceleration
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to determine which option refers to the measure of the change in velocity of a moving object.
1. The passage states: "Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object." This means acceleration is directly associated with velocity change.
2. Let's evaluate the options:
   - Option A: Compression - Compression typically refers to reducing volume or increasing pressure, not related to velocity.
   - Option B: Transmission - Transmission often refers to the transfer or conveyance of something, not specifically velocity-related.
   - Option C: Pressurization - Pressurization involves increasing pressure, not directly related to velocity.
   - Option D: Acceleration - As explicitly mentioned in the passage, acceleration is the measure of the change in velocity.
Given this analysis, the correct answer must be:
D. acceleration

Q: support:             Looking at different types of competition, ecologists developed the competitive exclusion principle . The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt, move from the area, or die out. In order for two species within the same area to coexist, they may adapt by developing different specializations. This is known as character displacement . An example of character displacement is when different birds adapt to eating different types of food. They can develop different types of bills, like Darwin’s Finches ( Figure below ). Therefore, competition for resources within and between species plays an important role in evolution through natural selection .             question:             What is the concept by which two species within the same area to coexist by adapting by developing different specializations?             options:             A. character concept B. character development C. character displacement D. feature displacement
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct concept, let's review the information provided in the question:
1. The competitive exclusion principle suggests that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt, move from the area, or die out.
2. To coexist within the same area, species may adapt by developing different specializations. 
3. This adaptation strategy is specifically referred to as "character displacement."
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. character concept - This is not the term described in the passage.
B. character development - This is not the specific term used; it is more general.
C. character displacement - This matches exactly with the term used in the passage for species adapting through different specializations to coexist.
D. feature displacement - This term does not appear in the passage.
Therefore, the correct answer is C. character displacement.

Q: support:             You can follow the operation of an electricity-generating fission reactor in the image above. The reactor core is submerged in a pool of water. The heat from the fission reaction heats the water, which is pumped into a heat exchange container. There the heated water boils the water in the heat exchanger. The produced steam is forced through a turbine that spins a generator and produces electricity. After the water passes through the turbine, it is condensed back to liquid water and pumped back to the heat exchanger.             question:             A turbine that spins a generator will produce?             options:             A. light B. magnetic fields C. electricity D. solar energy
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to determine what a turbine connected to a generator produces. Based on the description provided, the process involves:
1. Heat from a fission reaction heating water.
2. The heated water produces steam.
3. The steam is forced through a turbine.
4. The turbine spins a generator.
The primary function of a generator when spun by a turbine is to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Therefore, when the turbine spins the generator, the generator produces electricity.
Given the options:
A. Light - This is not produced by the turbine-generator system in this context.
B. Magnetic fields - Although magnetic fields are involved in the functioning of a generator (as they are used in the process of generating electricity), the outcome is the production of electricity, not just magnetic fields.
C. Electricity - This is the correct answer.
D. Solar energy - This is energy derived from the sun and is unrelated to the operation of a turbine connected to a generator in this context.
Thus, the turret and generator system converts the steam's kinetic energy into electricity, so the correct answer is:
C. electricity

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we first need to understand the context of meiosis in the sporophyte and what it produces.
1. **Understanding Sporophyte**: In the life cycle of plants and some algae, the sporophyte is the diploid multicellular stage. It arises from the fusion of gametes and produces spores through meiosis.
2. **Role of Meiosis**: Meiosis in the sporophyte involves reducing the chromosome number by half to produce haploid cells. This is crucial for sexual reproduction as it ensures the haploid condition is restored, which then can develop into a new organism.
3. **Haploid Cells Produced**: The process of meiosis in the sporophyte specifically produces spores, which are haploid. These spores can develop into a new organism without fertilization. 
4. **Evaluating Options**: 
   - A. Spores: Correct, as discussed above, because meiosis in the sporophyte produces spores.
   - B. Ions: Incorrect, as ions are atoms or molecules with an electric charge, not related to reproduction.
   - C. Fibers: Incorrect, fibers are structural, not reproductive.
   - D. Seeds: Incorrect, seeds are developed from fertilized ov

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, let's break it down step-by-step:
1. **Identify What the Question Asks:** The question describes a reaction where an element replaces another element in a compound, and importantly, the element is in either the solid, liquid, or gas state but is not an ion.
2. **Analyze the Options:**
   - **A. Polar reaction:** This term generally refers to interactions in polar molecules, not specifically to a type of chemical reaction where elements are exchanged.
   - **B. Single-replacement reaction:** This aligns well with the description given in the question. A single-replacement reaction involves one element replacing another element in a compound.
   - **C. Replication reaction:** This term is not typically used in the context of chemical reactions where elements are exchanged.
   - **D. Double-replacement reaction:** This involves the exchange of ions between two compounds but involves pairs of elements swapping places, which does not match the described process.
3. **Match the Description to the Correct Reaction Type:** The description in the question matches a single-replacement reaction, where an element (solid, liquid, or gas) replaces another in a compound.
Therefore, the correct choice is **B. single-replacement reaction**.

A: Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break down the options to determine the correct answer:
1. **A. DNA and Eukaryotes**: DNA is not a type of cell; it is a molecule that carries genetic instructions. Eukaryotes are a type of cell. This option is incorrect because DNA is not a cell type.
2. **B. Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes**: These are the two broad categories of cells found in the animal kingdom. Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. This option is correct.
3. **C. Bacteria and Eukaryotes**: Bacteria are a type of prokaryotic cell, but the question asks for broader categories. While eukaryotes is correct, bacteria only represents a subset of prokaryotes, not the category as a whole. Hence, this option is less accurate in context of the broad classification.
4. **D. Chromosomes and Eukaryotes**: Chromosomes are structures within cells that contain DNA, not a type of cell. Eukaryotes are a type of cell, making this option incorrect because chromosomes are not types of cells.

Q: support:             Metallic Solids Metals are characterized by their ability to reflect light, called luster, their high electrical and thermal conductivity, their high heat capacity, and their malleability and ductility. Every lattice point in a pure metallic element is occupied by an atom of the same metal. The packing efficiency in metallic crystals tends to be high, so the resulting metallic solids are dense, with each atom having as many as 12 nearest neighbors. Bonding in metallic solids is quite different from the bonding in the other kinds of solids we have discussed. Because all the atoms are the same, there can be no ionic bonding, yet metals always contain too few electrons or valence orbitals to form covalent bonds with each of their neighbors. Instead, the valence electrons are delocalized throughout the crystal, providing a strong cohesive force that holds the metal atoms together.             question:             What category of elements are chacterized by their ability to reflect light, called luster, their high electrical and thermal conductivity, their high heat capacity, and their malleability and ductility?             options:             A. noble gases B. nonmetals C. halogens D. metals
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which category of elements is characterized by the properties described, let's consider each property one by one:
1. **Reflect light (luster):** This is a characteristic feature of metals. Metals are known for their shiny appearance.
   
2. **High electrical and thermal conductivity:** Metals are excellent conductors of electricity and heat. This is due to the presence of delocalized electrons in metallic bonds.
   
3. **High heat capacity:** Metals generally have a high capacity to absorb and store heat.
   
4. **Malleability and ductility:** Metals can be hammered or rolled into sheets (malleable) and drawn into wires (ductile) without breaking. This is due to the nature of metallic bonding, which allows metal atoms to slide past each other without breaking the structural integrity.
Now, let's examine the options:
- **A. Noble gases:** These elements are typically gases at room temperature and are not metallic in nature. They don't possess luster, high conductivity, malleability, or ductility.
  
- **B. Nonmetals:** Nonmetals generally lack the properties given in the question. They are poor conductors of heat and electricity and don’t exhibit luster, malleability, or ductility.
  
- **

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. metals

Q: support:             Introduction Plants are as essential to human existence as land, water, and air. Without plants, our day-to-day lives would be impossible because without oxygen from photosynthesis, aerobic life cannot be sustained. From providing food and shelter to serving as a source of medicines, oils, perfumes, and industrial products, plants provide humans with numerous valuable resources. When you think of plants, most of the organisms that come to mind are vascular plants. These plants have tissues that conduct food and water, and they have seeds. Seed plants are divided into gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms include the needle-leaved conifers—spruce, fir, and pine—as well as less familiar plants, such as ginkgos and cycads. Their seeds are not enclosed by a fleshy fruit. Angiosperms, also called flowering plants, constitute the majority of seed plants. They include broadleaved trees (such as maple, oak, and elm), vegetables (such as potatoes, lettuce, and carrots), grasses, and plants known for the beauty of their flowers (roses, irises, and daffodils, for example). While individual plant species are unique, all share a common structure: a plant body consisting of stems, roots, and leaves. They all transport water, minerals, and sugars produced through photosynthesis through the plant body in a similar manner. All plant species also respond to environmental factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation.             question:             Angiosperms are also known as what?             options:             A. uncommon plants B. dry plants C. flowering plants D. dead plants
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the passage:
1. The passage mentions "Angiosperms" under the category of seed plants.
2. It states: "Angiosperms, also called flowering plants, constitute the majority of seed plants."
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. uncommon plants - The passage does not describe angiosperms as uncommon.
B. dry plants - The passage does not refer to angiosperms as dry.
C. flowering plants - The passage explicitly states that "Angiosperms, also called flowering plants..."
D. dead plants - The passage does not suggest that angiosperms are dead.
Based on the passage, the correct answer is C. flowering plants.

Q: support:             Mammals have the ability to regulate body temperature. This is an advantage, as Earth’s climate went through sudden and dramatic changes. Mastodons, saber tooth tigers, hoofed mammals, whales, primates and eventually humans all lived during the Cenozoic Era ( Figure below ).             question:             The ability to regulate what, which is possessed by mammals, was an advantage as earth’s climate went through sudden and dramatic changes?             options:             A. body temperature B. hair growth C. reflex behaviors D. mutations
A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking about the specific ability that mammals possess, which is advantageous during times when Earth's climate undergoes sudden and dramatic changes. The context provided in the support statement mentions that mammals can regulate "body temperature" and emphasizes this as an advantage during climate changes. 
Let's evaluate each option one by one:
- Option A: "body temperature" - This matches the key point mentioned in the support. The regulation of body temperature is indeed a notable ability of mammals and helps them survive in varying climatic conditions.
  
- Option B: "hair growth" - While mammals do have hair which can be an advantage in some climatic conditions, the statement specifically mentions regulation, which is more applicable to temperature rather than hair growth.
  
- Option C: "reflex behaviors" - Reflex behaviors are not mentioned in the support statement as related to climate change adaptations.
  
- Option D: "mutations" - While mutations can lead to evolutionary advantages, they are not directly related to the immediate regulation of internal conditions in response to climate changes as mentioned in the support.
Hence, the ability to regulate "body temperature" is the trait referenced in the support that provides an advantage during climatic changes. 
The correct answer is:
A. body temperature

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. body temperature

Q: support:             The majority of the human genome is non-coding sequence. These sequences include regulatory sequences, and DNA with unknown functions. These sequences include tandem repeat elements known as satellite DNA , and transposons. Satellite DNA consists of very large arrays of tandemly repeating, non-coding DNA. The repeating units can be just a single base (a mono nucleotide repeat), two bases (a dinucleotide repeat), three bases (a trinucleotide repeat) or a much larger repeating unit. Some repeating units are several thousand base pairs long, and the total size of a satellite DNA segment can be several megabases without interruption.             question:             What is the term for very large arrays of tandemly repeating, non-coding dna?             options:             A. addition dna B. satellite dna C. recombinant dna D. models dna
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct term for very large arrays of tandemly repeating, non-coding DNA, let's break down the information provided:
1. **The definition given**: The question asks about "very large arrays of tandemly repeating, non-coding DNA."
2. **Clue from the support text**: The support text specifically states, "Satellite DNA consists of very large arrays of tandemly repeating, non-coding DNA."
3. **Analysis of options**:
   - **A. addition dna**: This term is not typically associated with the description given.
   - **B. satellite dna**: Matches exactly with the description from the support text.
   - **C. recombinant dna**: This term refers to DNA molecules formed by laboratory techniques combining genetic material from multiple sources. It doesn’t match the description.
   - **D. models dna**: This term is not standard in describing repeating segments of DNA.
Based on the information given and the clear match in the support text, the correct answer is B. satellite dna.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. satellite dna.

Q: support:             Oceanographers use bathymetric maps to show the features of the bottom of a body of water.             question:             What kind of map can show the features of the bottom of a body of water?             options:             A. bathymetric B. topographic C. basic D. country
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the correct answer, we need to understand what each type of map mentioned in the options represents:
A. Bathymetric map: This type of map specifically shows the underwater features of a body of water. It is akin to an underwater topographic map and represents underwater terrains like the ocean floor, lake beds, and river bottoms. It uses contour lines based on depth data.
B. Topographic map: This map type shows the features of the earth's surface, including mountains, valleys, and plains, using contour lines to denote elevation. It is primarily concerned with land features.
C. Basic map: This is not a standard type of map with a specific focus or functionality. The term "basic" could mean a simple, general-purpose map without specialized detail.
D. Country map: This map type typically shows the geographical and political boundaries of countries and is focused on land areas rather than underwater terrain.
Given that the support provided specifically refers to showing the features of the bottom of a body of water, the correct answer should be one related to underwater features. Thus, the correct choice is:
A. Bathymetric

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. bathymetric

Q: support:             Migration Migration is the long-range seasonal movement of animals. It is an evolved, adapted response to variation in resource availability, and it is a common phenomenon found in all major groups of animals. Birds fly south for the winter to get to warmer climates with sufficient food, and salmon migrate to their spawning grounds. The popular 2005 documentary March of the Penguins followed the 62-mile migration of emperor penguins through Antarctica to bring food back to their breeding site and to their young. Wildebeests (Figure 45.35) migrate over 1800 miles each year in search of new grasslands.             question:             What evolved, adapted response to resource availability is the long-range seasonal movement of animals?             options:             A. migration B. changing C. regulating D. Stagnation
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided:
1. **Definition and Context**: The passage begins by defining "migration" as the long-range seasonal movement of animals. It further explains that migration is an evolved, adapted response to variation in resource availability. This definition directly ties migration to changes in resource availability, emphasizing its role as a survival strategy for animals.
2. **Examples**: Several examples of migration are given, such as birds flying south for warmer climates and better food resources, salmon migrating to spawning grounds, emperor penguins' migrations in Antarctica, and wildebeests traveling to new grasslands. Each example illustrates migration as a purposeful movement linked to acquiring necessary resources.
3. **The Question**: The question is asking which term represents the evolved, adapted response to resource availability that involves long-range seasonal movement.
4. **Options**: 
   - A. migration 
   - B. changing 
   - C. regulating 
   - D. stagnation
5. **Evaluation**:
   - A. Migration: This option directly aligns with the information and examples provided. Migration is explicitly described in the passage as the long-range movement tied to resource availability.
   - B. Changing: While change is involved in the resource availability that prompts

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. migration
