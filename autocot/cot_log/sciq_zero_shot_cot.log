Q: support:             Summary Changes of state are examples of phase changes, or phase transitions. All phase changes are accompanied by changes in the energy of a system. Changes from a more-ordered state to a less-ordered state (such as a liquid to a gas) areendothermic. Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always exothermic. The conversion of a solid to a liquid is called fusion (or melting). The energy required to melt 1 mol of a substance is its enthalpy of fusion (ΔHfus). The energy change required to vaporize 1 mol of a substance is the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap). The direct conversion of a solid to a gas is sublimation. The amount of energy needed to sublime 1 mol of a substance is its enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) and is the sum of the enthalpies of fusion and vaporization. Plots of the temperature of a substance versus heat added or versus heating time at a constant rate of heating are calledheating curves. Heating curves relate temperature changes to phase transitions. A superheated liquid, a liquid at a temperature and pressure at which it should be a gas, is not stable. A cooling curve is not exactly the reverse of the heating curve because many liquids do not freeze at the expected temperature. Instead, they form a supercooled liquid, a metastable liquid phase that exists below the normal melting point. Supercooled liquids usually crystallize on standing, or adding a seed crystal of the same or another substance can induce crystallization.             question:             Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always what?             options:             ['A. endothermic', 'B. reactive', 'C. exothermic', 'D. unbalanced']
A: Let's think step by step.
To address the question, we need to focus on the portion of the provided text that relates to changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state, such as from a liquid to a solid. The text states:
"Changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state (such as a liquid to a solid) are always exothermic."
Now, let's consider the options given:
- Option A: endothermic 
- Option B: reactive 
- Option C: exothermic 
- Option D: unbalanced
According to the provided text, changes from a less-ordered state to a more-ordered state are always "exothermic." Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. exothermic

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the least dangerous type of radioactive decay to living things, we need to consider the information provided in the statement. The statement says that all radioactive decay is dangerous to living things, but specifically mentions that alpha decay is the least dangerous among them.
Now, we will evaluate the given options:
- **A. Beta decay**: This type of radioactive decay involves the emission of beta particles (electrons or positrons), which can be more penetrating than alpha particles.
- **B. Alpha decay**: This type of decay involves the emission of alpha particles, which are relatively large and have low penetration power. They can be stopped by a sheet of paper or the outer layer of human skin, making them the least dangerous when outside the body.
- **C. Zeta decay**: There is no common type of radioactive decay known as zeta decay; this option can be disregarded.
- **D. Gamma decay**: This involves the emission of gamma rays, which are highly penetrating and can travel through the human body, making them more dangerous.
Based on the given information and the properties of these types of decay, the option that correctly answers the question "What is the least dangerous radioactive decay?" is:
**B. alpha decay**

Very active volcanoes characteristically eject red-hot rocks and lava rather than smoke and ash. Suppose a large rock is ejected from the volcano with a speed of 25.0 m/s and at an angle 35.0º above the horizontal, as shown in Figure 3.40. The rock strikes the side of the volcano at an altitude 20.0 m lower than its starting point. (a) Calculate the time it takes the rock to follow this path. (b) What are the magnitude and direction of the rock’s velocity at impact?.             question:             Kilauea in hawaii is the world’s most continuously active volcano. very active volcanoes characteristically eject red-hot rocks and lava rather than this?             options:             ['A. magma', 'B. smoke and ash', 'C. carbon and smog', 'D. greenhouse gases']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to determine what very active volcanoes typically eject, besides red-hot rocks and lava. The question is specifically contrasting what is characteristically ejected from very active volcanoes against red-hot rocks and lava.
1. Understanding the context: The statement mentions that Kilauea in Hawaii, as a very active volcano, characteristically ejects red-hot rocks and lava. This implies that what very active volcanoes eject is different from what is typically ejected from other types of volcanic eruptions.
2. Looking at the options: 
   - A. magma: Magma is molten rock beneath the Earth's surface, and when it erupts, it becomes lava. It's not typically referenced as an airborne product from an explosion.
   - B. smoke and ash: These are common products of explosive volcanic eruptions, which might contrast with the less explosive ejection of rocks and lava.
   - C. carbon and smog: These are more related to pollution than volcanic eruptions.
   - D. greenhouse gases: While volcanic eruptions do release gases, they are not typically grouped with the explosive solids of volcanic eruptions.
3. The correct contrast: 
   Given the context, since the early statement specifically mentions that Kilauea eject

Q: support:             Ring species Ring species demonstrate a version of allopatric speciation. Imagine populations of the species A. Over the geographic range of A there exist a number of subpopulations. These subpopulations (A1 to A5) and (Aa to Ae) have limited regions of overlap with one another but where they overlap they interbreed successfully. But populations A5 and Ae no longer interbreed successfully – are these populations separate species?  In this case, there is no clear-cut answer, but it is likely that in the link between the various populations will be broken and one or more species may form in the future. Consider the black bear Ursus americanus. Originally distributed across all of North America, its distribution is now much more fragmented. Isolated populations are free to adapt to their own particular environments and migration between populations is limited. Clearly the environment in Florida is different from that in Mexico, Alaska, or Newfoundland. Different environments will favor different adaptations. If, over time, these populations were to come back into contact with one another, they might or might not be able to interbreed successfully - reproductive isolation may occur and one species may become many.             question:             Organisms categorized by what species descriptor demonstrate a version of allopatric speciation and have limited regions of overlap with one another, but where they overlap they interbreed successfully?.             options:             ['A. surface species', 'B. ring species', 'C. fitting species', 'D. species complex']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to focus on the key features of the organisms described:
1. **Version of allopatric speciation:** The organisms demonstrate a version of allopatric speciation. Allopatric speciation occurs when populations of a species become geographically isolated, leading to the evolution of new species.
2. **Limited regions of overlap:** The populations have limited regions of overlap with one another. Geographical isolation is a key factor for these organisms.
3. **Interbreeding in overlapping regions:** Where these populations overlap, they interbreed successfully.
4. **Example given in the text:** The text uses the concept of a "ring" of subpopulations (e.g., A1 to A5, and Aa to Ae), where each adjacent subpopulation can interbreed, but the populations at the extremes (A5 and Ae) cannot interbreed successfully.
These characteristics are essential to a concept known as "ring species." These are populations that are connected in a ring-like formation around a geographical barrier. Each population can interbreed with its neighboring populations, but populations at the ends of the ring cannot interbreed.
Therefore, the organisms described by the species descriptor that demonstrate a version of allopatric speciation, have limited regions of overlap, and

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we first need to understand the context of the question and the information provided:
1. **Understanding Alpha Emission**: Alpha emission is a type of radioactivity. It involves the emission of an alpha particle from an unstable atomic nucleus. An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, making it identical to a helium nucleus.
2. **Effect of Emission**: After an alpha particle is emitted from an unstable nucleus, the original nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons, resulting in a new element that is two atomic numbers lower on the periodic table.
3. **Question and Options**: The question asks, "Alpha emission is a type of what?" with the options being:
   - A. Radiation
   - B. Light
   - C. Heat
   - D. Radioactivity
4. **Analyzing Options**:

Q: support:             One way to keep iron from corroding is to keep it painted. The layer of paint prevents the water and oxygen necessary for rust formation from coming into contact with the iron. As long as the paint remains intact, the iron is protected from corrosion. Other strategies include alloying the iron with other metals. For example, stainless steel is mostly iron with a bit of chromium. The chromium tends to collect near the surface, where it forms an oxide layer that protects the iron. Zinc-plated or galvanized iron uses a different strategy. Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron because zinc has a lower reduction potential. Since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is a more active metal. Thus, even if the zinc coating is scratched, the zinc will still oxidize before the iron. This suggests that this approach should work with other active metals. Another important way to protect metal is to make it the cathode in a galvanic cell. This is cathodic protection and can be used for metals other than just iron. For example, the rusting of underground iron storage tanks and pipes can be prevented or greatly reduced by connecting them to a more active metal such as zinc or magnesium (Figure 17.18). This is also used to protect the metal parts in water heaters. The more active metals (lower reduction potential) are called sacrificial anodes because as they get used up as they corrode (oxidize) at the anode. The metal being protected serves as the cathode, and so does not oxidize (corrode). When the anodes are properly monitored and periodically replaced, the useful lifetime of the iron storage tank can be greatly extended.             question:             Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron because zinc has a lower reduction potential. since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is a more what?             options:             ['A. Trap metal', 'B. much metal', 'C. usually metal', 'D. active metal']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the relationship between zinc's reduction potential and what type of metal it makes zinc compared to iron. The passage states:
1. "Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron because zinc has a lower reduction potential."
2. "Since zinc has a lower reduction potential, it is a more active metal."
From these statements, we understand that having a lower reduction potential means the metal is more active. This means that zinc is an active metal because it's more willing to give up electrons (oxidize) compared to iron.
Given the options:
- A. Trap metal
- B. Much metal
- C. Usually metal
- D. Active metal
The correct and logical choice based on the explanation provided in the passage is:
**D. Active metal**

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. Active metal'

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what is controlled by both genes and experiences in a given environment, let's examine the provided information:
1. The support statement specifies that most animal behaviors are controlled by both genes and experiences in a given environment.
2. We need to identify what is referred to as being controlled by both genes and experiences from the list of options.
Now, let's evaluate each option:
- **A. instincts**: Instincts are typically innate and largely controlled by genetic factors. They do not typically require environmental experiences to manifest.
- **B. reflexes**: Reflexes are automatic responses to stimuli and are also generally innate, controlled primarily by genetic factors rather than experiences.
- **C. learned behaviors**: Learned behaviors are primarily acquired through experiences in a given environment rather than being genetically pre-determined. Although genes can have an influence, learned behaviors are mostly about the environment and experiences.
- **D. animal behaviors**: This option encompasses a wide range of actions and reactions in animals, some of which (like learned behaviors) are influenced by both genetic and experiential factors.
According to the support statement, "most animal behaviors" are controlled by both genes and experiences, which fits option D.
Therefore, the correct answer is D. animal behaviors.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. animal behaviors'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, let's first understand the context:
1. **Gene Transcription**: This is the process where the information in a gene's DNA is converted into a functional product, like mRNA (messenger RNA), which will eventually lead to protein synthesis.
2. **Regulatory Proteins**: These are proteins that influence the transcription process by binding to specific regions on the DNA, known as regulatory elements. They can either enhance (activate) or inhibit (repress) the transcription of genes.
3. **Regulatory Elements**: These are specific sequences of DNA to which the regulatory proteins bind. Their role is crucial in turning genes on or off at the right times, ensuring that proteins are produced as needed by the cell.
Now, considering the question:
"What is controlled by regulatory proteins that bind to regulatory elements on DNA?"
The passage states that gene transcription is controlled by regulatory proteins binding to these elements. So, gene transcription is what is being regulated or controlled in this scenario.

In nature, it only occurs in compounds with oxygen. Boron is widely distributed in volcanic regions as boric acid, B(OH)3, and in dry lake regions, including the desert areas of California, as borates and salts of boron oxyacids, such as borax, Na2B4O7⋅10H2O. Elemental boron is chemically inert at room temperature, reacting with only fluorine and oxygen to form boron trifluoride, BF3, and boric oxide, B2O3, respectively. At higher temperatures, boron reacts with all nonmetals, except tellurium and the noble gases, and with nearly all metals; it oxidizes to B2O3 when heated with concentrated nitric or sulfuric acid. Boron does not react with nonoxidizing acids. Many boron compounds react readily with water to give boric acid, B(OH)3 (sometimes written as H3BO3). Reduction of boric oxide with magnesium powder forms boron (95–98.5% pure) as a brown, amorphous powder: B 2 O 3(s) + 3Mg(s) ⟶ 2B(s) + 3MgO(s) An amorphous substance is a material that appears to be a solid, but does not have a long-range order like a true solid. Treatment with hydrochloric acid removes the magnesium oxide. Further purification of the boron begins with conversion of the impure boron into boron trichloride. The next step is to heat a mixture of boron trichloride and hydrogen: 1500 °C.             question:             Boron only occurs naturally in compounds with what element?             options:             ['A. carbon', 'B. nitrogen', 'C. helium', 'D. oxygen']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks about the natural occurrence of boron in compounds. According to the provided passage, boron only occurs in compounds with oxygen in nature. This is evident in substances like boric acid and borates which are mentioned as natural occurrences of boron compounds. Therefore, the element that boron naturally occurs with in compounds is oxygen.
So, the correct option is:
D. oxygen

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. oxygen

Q: support:             42.1 Circulatory systems link exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body.             question:             What organ systems link exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body?             options:             ['A. circulatory', 'B. pulmonary', 'C. vascular', 'D. nervous']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which organ systems link exchange surfaces with cells throughout the body, we should consider the primary functions of each system given in the options:
A. Circulatory System: This system, which includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels, is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between exchange surfaces (like lungs and intestines) and cells throughout the body. The circulatory system directly links these exchange surfaces with all body cells.
B. Pulmonary System: This refers to the lungs and the structures involved in breathing. While it plays a critical role in exchanging gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) with the blood, it does not directly link with all cells—this is primarily a function of the circulatory system.
C. Vascular System: This is actually a part of the circulatory system that specifically refers to the network of blood vessels. It supports the function of linking exchange surfaces with cells by transporting blood, but the broader term "circulatory" encompasses all necessary components (heart, blood, and vessels).
D. Nervous System: This system is responsible for transmitting signals throughout the body, allowing communication between different parts. It doesn't transport substances like the circulatory system does.
From this analysis, option A, the circulatory system, is the

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. circulatory

Q: support:             All plants have a characteristic life cycle that includes alternation of generations . Plants alternate between haploid and diploid generations. Alternation of generations allows for both asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction with spores produces haploid individuals called gametophytes . Sexual reproduction with gametes and fertilization produces diploid individuals called sporophytes . A typical plant’s life cycle is diagrammed in Figure below .             question:             The plants alternation between haploid and diploud generations allow it to do what?             options:             ['A. reproduce sexually and autonomously', 'B. reproduce asexually and biologically', 'C. reproduce asexually and sexually', 'D. reproduce asexually and simultaneously']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what alternation of generations allows plants to do, we should understand what the alternation of generations means in terms of reproduction:
1. **Alternation of Generations**: Plants undergo a life cycle that includes both haploid and diploid phases. This means they switch between two types of generations:
   - **Haploid Generation (Gametophyte)**: This phase is involved with asexual reproduction and produces gametes (sperm and egg cells). 
   - **Diploid Generation (Sporophyte)**: This phase involves sexual reproduction, where gametes fuse (fertilization) to form a diploid organism.
2. **Types of Reproduction**:
   - **Asexual Reproduction**: This occurs during the gametophyte phase, where spores are produced that grow into new haploid individuals without the need for fertilization.
   - **Sexual Reproduction**: This occurs during the sporophyte phase, where haploid gametes (produced from the gametophyte phase) combine through fertilization to create new diploid individuals.
3. **Understanding the Options**:
   - **A. reproduce sexually and autonomously**: While plants do reproduce sexually, "autonomously" doesn't accurately describe

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'C. reproduce asexually and sexually'.  This option correctly reflects the ability of plants to alternate between generations, facilitating both types of reproduction.

Q: support:             Enzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its conversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.             question:             Most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by what?             options:             ['A. proteins', 'B. enzymes', 'C. vitamins', 'D. carbohydrates']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to carefully examine the information given in the support statement.
1. The support statement begins by stating that "Enzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning." This suggests that enzymes play a crucial role in various bodily processes.
2. It further elaborates that enzymes "assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its conversion to energy." This gives an example of the specific function of enzymes in the digestive process.
3. Most importantly, the statement notes that "most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes." This is the key part that directly answers the question.
The question is asking: "Most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by what?"
Given this, we look at the options provided:
- A. proteins
- B. enzymes
- C. vitamins
- D. carbohydrates
From the support statement, we learned that "most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes." Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. enzymes

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the answer to the question "What is the termination of a pregnancy in progress called?" let's go through the options one by one:
A. Abortion - This is a medical procedure or natural occurrence that ends a pregnancy. It is specifically the termination of an existing pregnancy.
B. Contraception - This refers to methods used to prevent pregnancy from occurring in the first place. It does not terminate an existing pregnancy.
C. Delivery - This refers to the birth process when the pregnancy reaches full term, resulting in the birth of a baby. It is not an intentional termination of the pregnancy.
D. Miscarriage - This is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before the fetus can survive outside the uterus. It is a type of termination, but it typically refers to an unintentional or natural end to a pregnancy as opposed to a deliberate procedure.
Given these definitions, the term specifically used for the voluntary termination of a pregnancy in progress is "abortion." Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. abortion

Q: support:             Cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers is one way to prevent dead zones in bodies of water. Preserving wetlands is also important. Wetlands are habitats such as swamps, marshes, and bogs where the ground is soggy or covered with water much of the year. Wetlands slow down and filter runoff before it reaches bodies of water. Wetlands also provide breeding grounds for many different species of organisms.             question:             Cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers and preserving wetlands are ways to prevent what "unlivable" regions in bodies of water?             options:             ['A. fresh zones', 'B. inhabitable zones', 'C. dead zones', 'D. hostile zones']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided:
1. **Understanding the context**:
   - The paragraph discusses methods to prevent certain conditions in bodies of water.
   - Two methods mentioned are cutting down on the use of chemical fertilizers and preserving wetlands.
2. **Key details**:
   - Chemical fertilizers contribute to problems in bodies of water which could lead to unlivable conditions.
   - Wetlands help by filtering runoff and providing environmental benefits, also related to mitigating these problems.
3. **Keyword: "unlivable" regions**:
   - The term hints at areas in bodies of water where life cannot be sustained, which are typically referred to as "dead zones."
4. **Analyzing options**:
   - A. "fresh zones" - This does not align with the context of preventing problems or unlivable conditions.
   - B. "inhabitable zones" - Although related to living conditions, this is not a standard term used in environmental discussions.
   - C. "dead zones" - This is a well-known term used to describe areas in bodies of water with insufficient oxygen to support marine life, caused by nutrient pollution including excess fertilizers.

Q: support:             Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand The intrinsic muscles of the hand both originate and insert within it (Figure 11.28). These muscles allow your fingers to also make precise movements for actions, such as typing or writing. These muscles are divided into three groups. The thenar muscles are on the radial aspect of the palm. The hypothenar muscles are on the medial aspect of the palm, and the intermediate muscles are midpalmar. The thenar muscles include the abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, flexor pollicis brevis, and the adductor pollicis. These muscles form the thenar eminence, the rounded contour of the base of the thumb, and all act on the thumb. The movements of the thumb play an integral role in most precise movements of the hand. The hypothenar muscles include the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, and the opponens digiti minimi. These muscles form the hypothenar eminence, the rounded contour of the little finger, and as such, they all act on the little finger. Finally, the intermediate muscles act on all the fingers and include the lumbrical, the palmar interossei, and the dorsal interossei.             question:             Which muscles allow your fingers to also make precise movements for actions?             options:             ['A. fine movement muscles', 'B. intrinsic muscles', 'C. motoric muscles', 'D. paired muscles']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which muscles allow for precise movements of the fingers, we first need to understand the information provided. The question refers to "precise movements for actions, such as typing or writing," which is described in the passage.
The passage explains that the intrinsic muscles of the hand both originate and insert within the hand and allow for precise finger movements. These intrinsic muscles are specified as being divided into three groups: the thenar muscles, the hypothenar muscles, and the intermediate muscles. All of these muscle groups together contribute to the fine motor movements of the hand.
Now, let's examine the options given:
- 'A. fine movement muscles': While this describes the function, it does not use the terminology found in the passage.
- 'B. intrinsic muscles': This directly matches the term used in the passage to describe muscles that enable precise movements.
- 'C. motoric muscles': This term does not specifically reference structures mentioned in the passage.
- 'D. paired muscles': This is not a relevant term from the passage and does not specifically pertain to the described muscles.
The correct answer is 'B. intrinsic muscles', as the passage directly attributes the capability for precise movements to these muscles.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. intrinsic muscles'.

Q: support:             any other electron, they become a part of the molecule’s electron system.204 This sharing of electrons produces what is known as a covalent bond. Covalent bonds are ~20 to 50 times stronger than van der Waals interactions. What exactly does that mean? Basically, it takes 20 to 50 times more energy to break a covalent bond compared to a van der Waals interaction. While the bonded form of atoms in a molecule is always more stable than the unbounded form, it may not be stable enough to withstand the energy delivered through collisions with neighboring molecules. Different bonds between different atoms in different molecular contexts differ in terms of bond stability; the bond energy refers the energy needed to break a particular bond. A molecule is stable if the bond energies associated with bonded atoms within the molecule are high enough to survive the energy delivered to the molecule through either collisions with neighboring molecules or the absorption of energy (light). When atoms form a covalent bond, their individual van der Waals surfaces merge to produce a new molecular van der Waals surface. There are a number of ways to draw molecules, but the spacefilling or van der Waals surface view is the most realistic (at least for our purposes). While realistic it can also be confusing, since it obscures the underlying molecular structure, that is, how the atoms in the molecule are linked together. This can be seen in this set of representations of the simple molecule 2methylpropane (→).205 As molecules become larger, as is the case with many biologically important molecules, it can become impossible to appreciate their underlying organization based on a van der Waals surface representation. Because they form a new stable entity, it is not surprising (perhaps) that the properties of a molecule are quite distinct from, although certainly influenced by, the properties of the atoms from which they are composed. To a first order approximation, a molecule’s properties are based on its shape, which is dictated by how the various atoms withjn the molecule are connected to one another. These geometries are imposed by each atom’s underlying quantum mechanical properties and (particularly as molecules get larger, as they so often do in biological systems) the interactions between different parts of the molecule with one another. Some atoms, common to biological systems, such as hydrogen (H), can form only a single covalent bond. Others can make two (oxygen (O) and sulfur (S)), three (nitrogen (N)), four (carbon (C)), or five (phosphorus (P)) bonds. In addition to smaller molecules, biological systems contain a number of distinct types of extremely large molecules, composed of many thousands of atoms; these are known as macromolecules. Such macromolecules are not rigid; they can often fold back on themselves leading to intramolecular interactions. There are also interactions between molecules. The strength and specificity of these interactions can vary dramatically and even small changes in molecular structure (such as caused by mutations and allelic variations) can have dramatic effects.             question:             This sharing of electrons produces what is known as a covalent bond. covalent bonds are ~20 to 50 times stronger than what?             options:             ['A. Mendelian systems', 'B. van der waals interactions', "C. Newton's third law", 'D. gravitational pull']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, let's first identify the key information provided:
1. The statement in question focuses on covalent bonds and a comparison is made about their strength relative to another type of interaction.
2. It is explicitly mentioned that "Covalent bonds are ~20 to 50 times stronger than van der Waals interactions."
The question asks what covalent bonds are 20 to 50 times stronger than. Looking at the options:
- A. Mendelian systems: These refer to genetic inheritance patterns, not related to bond strength.
- B. van der Waals interactions: These are intermolecular forces that are indeed mentioned in the passage. The passage states that covalent bonds are much stronger than these interactions.
- C. Newton's third law: This is a principle of physics related to motion, not bond strength.
- D. gravitational pull: This is a force related to mass and distance, again not directly related to chemical bond strength.
Given the information in the passage, the correct answer is:
B. van der Waals interactions

Q: support:             Water molecules move about continuously due to their kinetic energy. When a crystal of sodium chloride is placed into water, the water’s molecules collide with the crystal lattice. Recall that the crystal lattice is composed of alternating positive and negative ions. Water is attracted to the sodium chloride crystal because water is polar and has both a positive and a negative end. The positively charged sodium ions in the crystal attract the oxygen end of the water molecules because they are partially negative. The negatively charged chloride ions in the crystal attract the hydrogen end of the water molecules because they are partially positive. The action of the polar water molecules takes the crystal lattice apart (see image below).             question:             Water molecules move about continuously due to what type of energy?             options:             ['A. potential', 'B. seismic', 'C. kinetic', 'D. optical']

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the context provided in the support text:
1. The text mentions two key aspects of geologic maps: they display "rock units" and "geologic features."
2. It specifies that "a small scale map displays individual rock units."
3. The question asks for the type of map where a "small scale version" would display individual rock units.
Given this information, we can evaluate the options:
- **A. Polar map**: Polar maps are typically related to large-scale mapping of polar regions and are not specifically concerned with displaying rock units.
- **B. Geologic map**: According to the support text, geologic maps display rock units, which directly matches the description given for the small scale map.
- **C. Seismic map**: Seismic maps display data related to seismic activity, such as earthquake epicenters, and are not primarily used to display individual rock units.
- **D. Geographic map**: Geographic maps show features of the Earth's surface, such as physical landscapes, political boundaries, and infrastructure but do not primarily focus on displaying rock units.
Based on the support provided, the definition of a small scale map displaying "individual rock units" best aligns with a **geologic map

The main pituitary hormone involved is luteinizing hormone (LH) . It stimulates the testes to secrete testosterone. Testosterone, in turn, promotes protein synthesis and growth. It brings about most of the physical changes of puberty, some of which are shown in Figure below . In addition to the changes shown below, during puberty male facial hair begins to grow, the shoulders broaden, and the male voice deepens. You can watch an animation of these and other changes that occur in boys during puberty at the Interactive Body link: http://www. bbc. co. uk/science/humanbody/body/interactives/lifecycle/teenagers/ .             question:             What hormone, which is associated with luteinizing hormone and male sexuality, helps bring about physical changes in puberty?             options:             ['A. epinephrine', 'B. estrogen', 'C. testosterone', 'D. steroids']
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the correct answer, let's break down the information provided:
1. The hypothalamus triggers the pituitary gland to secrete hormones targeting the testes.
2. The pituitary hormone involved in this process is luteinizing hormone (LH).
3. LH stimulates the testes to produce testosterone.
4. Testosterone promotes protein synthesis and growth, leading to physical changes during puberty in males.
5. Examples of these changes include the growth of facial hair, broader shoulders, and a deeper voice.
From this information, we can deduce which hormone is associated with luteinizing hormone (LH) and helps bring about physical changes during puberty:
- Option A: Epinephrine - This hormone is more commonly known as adrenaline and is not directly involved in physical changes during male puberty.
- Option B: Estrogen - This hormone is primarily associated with female sexual development and is not the hormone responsible for the changes in males during puberty.
- Option C: Testosterone - This hormone is directly mentioned as being stimulated by LH and is responsible for the physical changes in puberty for males.
- Option D: Steroids - While anabolic steroids are synthesized to mimic testosterone, they are not the naturally occurring hormone responsible for puberty changes.
Considering all the information, the correct answer is:
C. testosterone

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. testosterone

A: Let's think step by step.
Photosynthetic protists are organisms that can convert light energy into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis, similar to plants. The question asks what photosynthetic protists use to create food. 
1. **Photosynthesis Process**: 
   - Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae, and some protists to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. 
2. **Key Input for Photosynthesis**:
   - The primary input for photosynthesis is light energy, typically from the sun. 
3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A. light energy**: This is the energy used in photosynthesis to produce food, so this option is correct.
   - **B. hydrocarbons**: These are organic compounds consisting of hydrogen and carbon, but they are not used as the initial energy source in photosynthesis.
   - **C. decayed matter**: This is not used by photosynthetic organisms to create food but instead is more relevant in decomposer activities.
   - **D. thermal energy**: This refers to heat energy, which is not the primary source of energy for photosynthesis.
Therefore, based on the process of photosynthesis and the provided options, the correct answer is `A. light energy`.

Q: support:             Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates. They are bipedal, which means they walk on two legs. Birds also lay amniotic eggs, and the eggs have hard, calcium carbonate shells. Although birds are the most recent class of vertebrates to evolve, they are now the most numerous vertebrates on Earth. Why have birds been so successful? What traits allowed them to increase and diversify so rapidly?.             question:             What type of vertebrates are birds?             options:             ['A. epidermal tetrapod', 'B. endothermic tetrapod', 'C. exothermic', 'D. invertebrates']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify the type of vertebrates that birds are, according to the given information.
The provided support states, "Birds are endothermic tetrapod vertebrates." This sentence clearly indicates that birds are a type of vertebrate characterized by being endothermic tetrapods.
Now, let's compare this description with the options given:
- Option A: "epidermal tetrapod" - This does not match the given description, as "epidermal" is not mentioned in the context.
- Option B: "endothermic tetrapod" - This matches exactly with the description in the support, where birds are identified as "endothermic tetrapod vertebrates."
- Option C: "exothermic" - This contradicts the given description because "exothermic" refers to an organism that relies on external sources of heat, whereas "endothermic" (as stated in the support) means birds generate their own heat.
- Option D: "invertebrates" - This is incorrect since birds are already classified as vertebrates.
Therefore, the type of vertebrates that birds are, based on the given information, is "endothermic tetrapod." Thus, the correct option

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is Option B: "endothermic tetrapod."

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we should first understand what an ionic compound is. Ionic compounds are chemical compounds composed of ions held together by electrostatic forces termed ionic bonding. These compounds are typically formed when a metal loses electrons to become a positive ion (cation) and a nonmetal gains those electrons to become a negative ion (anion).
Given this information, the question asks, "What type of ions do ionic compounds contain?" The possible options provided are:
- A. positive and charged
- B. regular and irregular
- C. positive and negative
- D. negative and neutral
Since ionic compounds are comprised of both cations and anions, they contain both positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions). Therefore, the most accurate answer is:
C. positive and negative

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. positive and negative

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question "All living things need air and this to survive?", let's analyze the elements provided and common knowledge about the needs of living organisms.
1. **Air**: All living things need air, primarily for oxygen, which is critical for cellular respiration, a process essential for energy production.
2. **Water**: Water is another fundamental need for all living organisms. It is necessary for numerous biological processes, including digestion, temperature regulation, and as a solvent in which chemical reactions occur.
3. **Other Options**:
   - **Habitat**: While a habitat is important as it provides the environment where organisms live, it is not as fundamentally required for the basic survival needs in the immediate sense compared to air or water.
   - **Stimuli**: Living organisms respond to stimuli, but stimuli are not a requirement for survival in the same way water or air are.
   - **Ecosystem**: An ecosystem includes living and non-living things interacting together, but like habitat, it’s more about the environment rather than a direct necessity like air or water.
Given these explanations, the primary needs of living organisms besides air are indeed water, food, and nutrients. Among the options provided, "D. water" is the most apt choice as

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is "D. water" as it is the most direct and essential requirement for the survival of living organisms alongside air.

Q: support:             temperatures with electropositive metals such as those of groups 1 and 2 and aluminum produces ionic carbides, which contain discrete metal cations and carbon anions. The identity of the anions depends on the size of the second element. For example, smaller elements such as beryllium and aluminum give methides such as Be2C and Al4C3, which formally contain the C4− ion derived from methane (CH4) by losing all four H atoms as protons. In contrast, larger metals such as sodium and calcium give carbides with stoichiometries of Na2C2 and CaC2. Because these carbides contain the C4− ion, which is derived from acetylene (HC≡CH) by losing both H atoms as protons, they are more properly called acetylides. As discussed in Chapter 21 "Periodic Trends and the ", Section 21.4 "The Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2)", reacting ionic carbides with dilute aqueous acid results in protonation of the anions to give the parent hydrocarbons: CH4 or C2H2. For many years, miners’ lamps used the reaction of calcium carbide with water to produce a steady supply of acetylene, which was ignited to provide a portable lantern. The reaction of carbon with most transition metals at high temperatures produces interstitial carbides. Due to the less electropositive nature of the transition metals, these carbides contain covalent metal– carbon interactions, which result in different properties: most interstitial carbides are good conductors of electricity, have high melting points, and are among the hardest substances known. Interstitial carbides exhibit a variety of nominal compositions, and they are often nonstoichiometric compounds whose carbon content can vary over a wide range. Among the most important are tungsten carbide (WC), which is used industrially in high-speed cutting tools, and cementite (Fe3C), which is a major component of steel. Elements with an electronegativity similar to that of carbon form covalent carbides, such as silicon carbide (SiC; Equation 22.15) and boron carbide (B4C). These substances are extremely hard, have high melting points, and are chemically inert. For example, silicon carbide is highly resistant to chemical attack at temperatures as high as 1600°C. Because it also maintains its strength at high temperatures, silicon carbide is used in heating elements for electric furnaces and in variable-temperature resistors.             question:             Interstitial carbides are produced by the reaction of most transition metals at high temperatures with what element?             options:             ['A. oxygen', 'B. nitrogen', 'C. hydrogen', 'D. carbon']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to focus on the information provided about interstitial carbides.
1. **Identify the Reactants for Interstitial Carbides:** The passage states: "The reaction of carbon with most transition metals at high temperatures produces interstitial carbides." This gives us a direct clue that the reaction involves transition metals and carbon.
2. **Verify the Reaction product:** Interstitial carbides are indeed a result of the reaction between transition metals and carbon at high temperatures. They are distinguished by covalent metal-carbon interactions due to the less electropositive nature of transition metals.
3. **Choose the Correct Element:** The options provided are oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon. Based on the passage, we have already identified that carbon is the element that reacts with transition metals to form interstitial carbides.
Thus, the element is carbon.
The correct answer is: **D. carbon**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. carbon.

Q: support:             Agents of Decomposition The fungus-like protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes. For instance, many types of oomycetes grow on dead animals or algae. Saprobic protists have the essential function of returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water. This process allows for new plant growth, which in turn generates sustenance for other organisms along the food chain. Indeed, without saprobe species, such as protists, fungi, and bacteria, life would cease to exist as all organic carbon became “tied up” in dead organisms.             question:             Fungus-like protist saprobes play what role in a food chain and are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter, such as dead organisms or their wastes?             options:             ['A. aphids', 'B. decomposers', 'C. fluxes', 'D.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the role that fungus-like protist saprobes play in a food chain, we need to closely examine the information provided.
1. The text states that fungus-like protist saprobes are specialized to absorb nutrients from nonliving organic matter like dead organisms or their wastes.
2. The essential function of these saprobic protists is returning inorganic nutrients to the soil and water, which facilitates new plant growth.
3. This process of breaking down and recycling nutrients from dead organic matter is critical for food chain sustainability because it allows for plant growth, which then supports other organisms.
4. In ecological terms, organisms that break down dead or decaying matter are known as decomposers. 
5. The absence of such organisms would result in the accumulation of organic carbon in dead organisms, disrupting the flow of energy and nutrients through the food chain.
Considering the information above, the role that fungus-like protist saprobes play in a food chain is that of decomposers. This aligns with option 'B. decomposers'.
Thus, the correct answer is: **B. decomposers**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. decomposers.

Some ribosomes are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (as shown in Figure below ), and others are attached to the nuclear envelope.             question:             What are the sites of protein synthesis or assembly?             options:             ['A. chloroplasts', 'B. ribosomes', 'C. chromosomes', 'D. plasma']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to refer to the information given in the support section.
- The support section states that "Ribosomes are small organelles and are the sites of protein synthesis (or assembly)."
- It specifies that ribosomes are made of ribosomal protein and ribosomal RNA.
- Ribosomes are found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and are not surrounded by a membrane.
- They have two subunits (large and small) and can be found either freely within the cytoplasm or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope.
Based on the information provided, the support explicitly identifies ribosomes as the sites of protein synthesis.
Now, let's look at the options provided:
- A. chloroplasts

Q: support:             Meiosis I begins after DNA replicates during interphase of the cell cycle. In both meiosis I and meiosis II , cells go through the same four phases as mitosis - prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. However, there are important differences between meiosis I and mitosis. The eight stages of meiosis are summarized below. The stages will be described for a human cell, starting with 46 chromosomes.             question:             What must replicate in the cell cycle before meiosis i takes place?             options:             ['A. meiotic fluid', 'B. dna', 'C. cell walls', 'D. sperm']
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what must replicate before meiosis I takes place, we need to consider the sequence of events in the cell cycle. The cell cycle consists of several phases, including interphase and the division phases. Interphase itself includes the G1, S, and G2 phases. 
During the S phase (Synthesis phase) of interphase, DNA replication occurs. This is crucial because meiosis (just like mitosis) requires the duplication of the cell’s DNA so that the resulting daughter cells (or gametes in the case of meiosis) have the correct amount of genetic information. 
Given this understanding, before meiosis I begins, the DNA within the cell must replicate. This ensures that each of the resulting gametes has the necessary genetic material, despite undergoing two rounds of division in meiosis.
Now, let's examine the options provided:
- A. Meiotic fluid: This is not directly involved in replication within the cell cycle.
- B. DNA: This is the correct option, as DNA must replicate during interphase before meiosis I begins.
- C. Cell walls: This is irrelevant to the replication process described.
- D. Sperm: Sperm are the result of meiosis, not a component that replicates prior to meiosis I.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. dna'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the phenomenon primarily resulting from plate tectonic motions, we need to examine the relationship between these motions and various geological phenomena. 
1. **Plate Tectonics and Earthquakes**:
   - Earthquakes are directly caused by the movements and interactions of tectonic plates. 
   - When plates grind against each other or overlap, stress accumulates at the boundaries and is eventually released as seismic waves—resulting in earthquakes.
   - Types of plate boundaries: 
     - **Convergent Boundaries**: Where plates move toward each other, causing compression stress.
     - **Divergent Boundaries**: Where plates move apart, resulting in tension stress.
     - **Transform Boundaries**: Where plates slide horizontally past each other, causing shear stress.
2. **Other Phenomena**:
   - **Tsunamis** (Option A): These are often a secondary effect of earthquakes, especially those occurring under the ocean, but they are not directly caused by plate motion.
   - **Eruption** (Option B): This is not a phenomenon but an event. Volcanic eruptions can be influenced by plate tectonics where subduction leads to magma formation, but they are not primarily a direct result of plate movement like earthquakes.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. earthquake'.

Q: support:             Ganglia A ganglion is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery. Ganglia can be categorized, for the most part, as either sensory ganglia or autonomic ganglia, referring to their primary functions. The most common type of sensory ganglion is a dorsal (posterior) root ganglion. These ganglia are the cell bodies of neurons with axons that are sensory endings in the periphery, such as in the skin, and that extend into the CNS through the dorsal nerve root. The ganglion is an enlargement of the nerve root. Under microscopic inspection, it can be seen to include the cell bodies of the neurons, as well as bundles of fibers that are the posterior nerve root (Figure 13.19). The cells of the dorsal root ganglion are unipolar cells, classifying them by shape. Also, the small round nuclei of satellite cells can be seen surrounding—as if they were orbiting—the neuron cell bodies.             question:             What is a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery called?             options:             ['A. organism', 'B. crystals', 'C. gangism', 'D. ganglion']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the provided support text.
1. The text begins by defining a **ganglion** as a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery.
2. It further explains that ganglia can be categorized as either sensory or autonomic, highlighting their primary functions.
3. The text provides additional context that the **dorsal root ganglion** is a common type of sensory ganglion.
Based on all of this information, it is evident that a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery is called a "ganglion." 
Now, let's examine the given options:
- A. organism
- B. crystals
- C. gangism
- D. ganglion
The correct option that identifies a group of neuron cell bodies in the periphery is:
- D. ganglion
Therefore, the answer is D. ganglion.

Q: support:             Under what conditions then, do gases behave least ideally? When a gas is put under high pressure, its molecules are forced closer together as the empty space between the particles is diminished. A decrease in the empty space means that the assumption that the volume of the particles themselves is negligible is less valid. When a gas is cooled, the decrease in kinetic energy of the particles causes them to slow down. If the particles are moving at slower speeds, the attractive forces between them are more prominent. Another way to view it is that continued cooling the gas will eventually turn it into a liquid and a liquid is certainly not an ideal gas anymore (see liquid nitrogen in the Figure below ). In summary, a real gas deviates most from an ideal gas at low temperatures and high pressures. Gases are most ideal at high temperature and low pressure.             question:             Gases are most ideal at high temperature and what pressure?             options:             ['A. absolute', 'B. low', 'C. high', 'D. stable']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the conditions under which gases behave most ideally, we need to recall the characteristics that define an ideal gas. An ideal gas follows the ideal gas law perfectly, meaning it obeys the assumptions where the volume of gas particles is negligible, and there are no intermolecular forces between the particles.
According to the prompt, gases deviate most from ideal behavior at low temperatures and high pressures. This deviation occurs because:
1. High Pressure: The molecules are forced closer together, making the volume of the molecules non-negligible.
2. Low Temperature: The decreased kinetic energy results in increased significance of intermolecular forces.
Conversely, gases behave most ideally when these deviations are minimized. Therefore, gases are most ideal under conditions of:
1. High Temperature: This increases the kinetic energy of the gas particles, reducing the effects of intermolecular attractions.
2. Low Pressure: This increases the space between particles, making their volume negligible compared to the total volume of the gas.
Given these considerations, the correct answer is that gases are most ideal at high temperature and low pressure. 
Therefore, the correct option from the given choices is:
B. low

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. low

Q: support:             Each type of rock weathers in its own way. Certain types of rock are very resistant to weathering. Igneous rocks tend to weather slowly because they are hard. Water cannot easily penetrate them. Granite is a very stable igneous rock. Other types of rock are easily weathered because they dissolve easily in weak acids. Limestone is a sedimentary rock that dissolves easily. When softer rocks wear away, the more resistant rocks form ridges or hills.             question:             Hard igneous rocks and easily dissolved sedimentary rocks respond very differently to what natural force?             options:             ['A. evaporation', 'B. sunlight', 'C. gravity', 'D. weathering']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to identify the natural force that causes hard igneous rocks and easily dissolved sedimentary rocks to respond differently. 
The support text provides relevant information about how different types of rocks respond to natural forces. It mentions that igneous rocks weather slowly because they are hard and not easily penetrated by water. In contrast, sedimentary rocks like limestone dissolve easily in weak acids and are more prone to weathering. The text states that weathering causes rocks to respond differently: softer rocks wear away more quickly, leading to the formation of ridges or hills from the more resistant rocks.
Therefore, the natural force that causes these differing responses is weathering.
The correct option is:
'D. weathering'

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. weathering'

Q: support:             The metals of group 13 (Al, Ga, In, and Tl) are all reactive. However, passivation occurs as a tough, hard, thin film of the metal oxide forms upon exposure to air. Disruption of this film may counter the passivation, allowing the metal to react. One way to disrupt the film is to expose the passivated metal to mercury. Some of the metal dissolves in the mercury to form an amalgam, which sheds the protective oxide layer to expose the metal to further reaction. The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water.             question:             The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with what?             options:             ['A. blood and sweat', 'B. helium and oxygen', 'C. air and water', 'D. cloth and plastic']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we'll analyze the information provided in the support section.
1. **Reactive Metals and Passivation:** The metals in group 13 (Aluminum (Al), Gallium (Ga), Indium (In), and Thallium (Tl)) are reactive. However, when they form a tough, hard, thin film of metal oxide, they become passivated, meaning they are protected from further reaction.
2. **Disrupting Passivation:** When this protective oxide layer is disrupted, the passivation effect is lost. One method to disrupt this layer is by exposing the metal to mercury. 
3. **Formation of Amalgam:** When the metal is exposed to mercury, some of it dissolves in the mercury, forming an amalgam. This process sheds the oxide layer.
4. **Exposure to Further Reaction:** Once the oxide layer is removed, the metal is exposed to further reaction. The text explicitly states, "The formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water."
Given this analysis, the formation of an amalgam allows the metal to react with air and water.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
'C. air and water'

Q: support:             automobile axle drives a wheel, which has a much larger diameter than the axle. The MA is less than 1. (c) An ordinary pulley is used to lift a heavy load. The pulley changes the direction of the force T exerted by the cord without changing its magnitude. Hence, this machine has an MA of 1.             question:             A pulley changes the direction of the force t exerted by the cord without changing its what?             options:             ['A. longitude', 'B. position', 'C. magnitude', 'D. latitude']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is correct, let's consider how a pulley operates:
1. A pulley is a simple machine that consists of a wheel on an axle, designed to support the movement and change direction of a taut cable or belt along its circumference.
2. The main function of a pulley in this context is to change the direction of the force exerted by the cord (or rope). For instance, it can allow you to pull down to lift a load upwards.
3. The key aspect mentioned is that the pulley changes the direction of the force without altering another specific property of the force applied through the cord.
4. The options provided are:
   - A. longitude
   - B. position
   - C. magnitude
   - D. latitude
5. In physics and mechanical contexts, the magnitude of a force refers to its size or amount (often measured in units like newtons). 
6. When it's mentioned that the pulley changes the direction of the force without changing its *magnitude*, it implies that the strength or size of the force remains constant; only its direction changes.
Thus, the correct answer is C. magnitude.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. magnitude

Different types of papillae are found in different regions of the tongue. The taste buds contain specialized gustatory receptor cells that respond to chemical stimuli dissolved in the saliva. These receptor cells activate sensory neurons that are part of the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves. LM × 1600. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012).             question:             What is the name of the small bumps that contain taste buds and covers the tongue?             options:             ['A. lingual tonsils', 'B. cuticle', 'C. palatine tonsils', 'D. papillae']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we'll analyze the given information.
1. The information states: "The tongue is covered with small bumps, called papillae, which contain taste buds."
2. The function of these small bumps (papillae) is to contain taste buds that are sensitive to chemicals in ingested food or drink.
Now let's examine the options provided:
- A. lingual tonsils: These are not bumps that cover the tongue; they are part of the immune system and are located at the base of the tongue.
- B. cuticle: This term generally refers to the outer layer of skin or an epidermal layer, not something covering the tongue related to taste.
- C. palatine tonsils: These are located at the back of the throat and are part of the immune system, not structures covering the tongue related to taste.
- D. papillae: These are indeed the small bumps on the tongue that contain taste buds.
From the options given, the correct answer is 'D. papillae', as they match the description given in the support text of being the small bumps that cover the tongue and contain taste buds.

Q: support:             What if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the same distance above the ground? The bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is greater. Would it fall to the ground faster? No, the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time. The reason? The more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass, so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball. This is true of all falling objects. They all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity, unless air resistance affects one object more than another. For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area. You can simulate the effect of air resistance on acceleration due to gravity by doing the interactive animation at this URL: http://www. science-animations. com/support-files/freefall. swf.             question:             In the absence of air resistance, all falling objects accelerate at the same rate due to what force?             options:             ['A. weight', 'B. motion', 'C. velocity', 'D. gravity']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's break down the concepts related to falling objects and gravity:
1. **Weight and Gravity**: Weight is the force exerted by gravity on an object. While weight depends on the mass of the object, the acceleration it experiences due to gravity is the same for all objects near the Earth's surface (approximately 9.8 m/s²).
2. **Motion and Velocity**: These terms describe the movement of an object. Motion is the change in position, while velocity is the speed of an object in a given direction. These are results of forces acting on an object rather than forces themselves.
3. **Gravity**: Gravity is the force that attracts objects with mass toward one another. Near Earth, it causes objects to accelerate downward at the same constant rate when there's no air resistance, irrespective of their mass.
Considering these points, the correct answer to the question "In the absence of air resistance, all falling objects accelerate at the same rate due to what force?" is:
- **D. gravity**

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. gravity'

It protects and supports the cell and also controls everything that enters and leaves the cell. It allows only certain substances to pass through, while keeping others in or out. The ability to allow only certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as selective permeability or semipermeability. To understand how the plasma membrane controls what crosses into or out of the cell, you need to know its composition.             question:             The ability for a plasma membrane to only allow certain molecules in or out of the cell is referred to as what?             options:             ['A. selective permeability', 'B. periodic permeability', 'C. moderate permeability', 'D. total permeability']

1. The support text describes the plasma membrane's function of allowing only specific substances to pass in or out of the cell while blocking others.
2. This characteristic is explicitly referred to in the text as "selective permeability" or "semipermeability."
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- A. selective permeability: This matches the description given in the text for the plasma membrane's ability to control what enters or leaves the cell.
- B. periodic permeability: This term is not used in the context of the plasma membrane in the text and doesn't accurately describe the function mentioned.
- C. moderate permeability: This term does not accurately convey the concept of allowing certain molecules through while excluding others.
- D. total permeability: This would imply everything is allowed to pass through, which is contrary to the concept described in the text.
Based on the analysis, the answer is:
A. selective permeability

Q: support:             The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed. The greater the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is. For example, light refracts more when it passes from air to diamond than it does when it passes from air to water. That’s because the speed of light is slower in diamond than it is in water.             question:             The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium is known as what?             options:             ['A. frequency', 'B. resonance', 'C. refraction', 'D. bounce']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to understand the context and find the correct term for the angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium. The passage provides information on how light behaves when moving from one medium to another, emphasizing that the angle of bending depends on the change in speed of light due to the transition between different media.
The passage explicitly mentions the term "angle of refraction" to describe this bending of light. Therefore, we need to identify which of the options corresponds to this concept.
Let's review the options:
- A. frequency: Frequency refers to the number of waves that pass a point in a given unit of time. It is not related to the bending of light.
- B. resonance: Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when a system is driven by an external force at a frequency equal to its natural frequency. It does not relate to light bending.
- C. refraction: Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different speed of light. This is exactly what the passage describes.
- D. bounce: Bounce might imply reflection rather than refraction. It is not the correct term for the bending of light.
Based on the above analysis, the correct choice is:
C. refraction

Q: support:             The Energy Cycle Whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate molecules. But if plants make carbohydrate molecules, why would they need to break them down, especially when it has been shown that the gas organisms release as a “waste product” (CO2) acts as a substrate for the formation of more food in photosynthesis? Remember, living things need energy to perform life functions. In addition, an organism can either make its own food or eat another organism—either way, the food still needs to be broken down. Finally, in the process of breaking down food, called cellular respiration, heterotrophs release needed energy and produce “waste” in the form of CO2 gas. In nature, there is no such thing as waste. Every single atom of matter and energy is conserved, recycling over and over infinitely. Substances change form or move from one type of molecule to another, but their constituent atoms never disappear (Figure 8.20). CO2 is no more a form of waste than oxygen is wasteful to photosynthesis. Both are byproducts of reactions that move on to other reactions. Photosynthesis absorbs light energy to build carbohydrates in chloroplasts, and aerobic cellular respiration releases energy by using oxygen to metabolize carbohydrates in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Both processes use electron transport chains to capture the energy necessary to drive other reactions. These two powerhouse processes, photosynthesis and cellular respiration, function in biological, cyclical harmony to allow organisms to access life-sustaining energy that originates millions of miles away in a burning star humans call the sun.             question:             Whether the organism is a bacterium, plant, or animal, all living things access energy by breaking down these?             options:             ['A. carbohydrate molecules', 'B. lipid molecules', 'C. protein molecules', 'D. oxygen molecules']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks how living organisms access energy. The provided text explains that all living organisms, whether bacteria, plants, or animals, access energy by breaking down carbohydrate molecules. The key information from the text is:
1. The text explicitly states: "all living things access energy by breaking down carbohydrate molecules."
2. It also mentions that even plants, which produce carbohydrate molecules, break them down during cellular respiration to release energy.
3. The processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration both involve carbohydrates.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify the relationship between temperature and energy in the context of N2 molecules.
1. The given statement is: "Increasing the temperature increases the average kinetic energy of the N2 molecules."
2. Temperature is directly related to the kinetic energy of molecules. When temperature increases, molecules move more vigorously, meaning their kinetic energy increases. 
3. The question is asking: "Increasing the temperature of N2 molecules increases what energy of motion?"
Looking at the options:
- A. Emotional energy: This is not a scientific term related to molecular motion. 
- B. Compression energy: This relates to energy stored during compression, not relevant to molecule movement directly.
- C. Residual energy: This is leftover energy, not directly related to the energy of motion.
- D. Kinetic energy: This is the energy associated with the motion of particles.
Since increasing the temperature increases the average kinetic energy, the correct answer is clearly:
D. kinetic energy.

Q: support:             FM radio is inherently less subject to noise from stray radio sources than AM radio. The reason is that amplitudes of waves add. So an AM receiver would interpret noise added onto the amplitude of its carrier wave as part of the information. An FM receiver can be made to reject amplitudes other than that of the basic carrier wave and only look for variations in frequency. It is thus easier to reject noise from FM, since noise produces a variation in amplitude. Television is also broadcast on electromagnetic waves. Since the waves must carry a great deal of visual as well as audio information, each channel requires a larger range of frequencies than simple radio transmission. TV channels utilize frequencies in the range of 54 to 88 MHz and 174 to 222 MHz. (The entire FM radio band lies between channels 88 MHz and 174 MHz. ) These TV channels are called VHF (for very high frequency). Other channels called UHF (for ultra high frequency) utilize an even higher frequency range of 470 to 1000 MHz. The TV video signal is AM, while the TV audio is FM. Note that these frequencies are those of free transmission with the user utilizing an old-fashioned roof antenna. Satellite dishes and cable transmission of TV occurs at significantly higher frequencies and is rapidly evolving with the use of the high-definition or HD format.             question:             Which radio frequency should you listen to if you want less noise?             options:             ['A. wave', 'B. fm', 'C. am', 'D. cb']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which radio frequency provides less noise, we need to look at how FM and AM radio transmissions handle noise. 
1. **AM Radio (Amplitude Modulation)**: In AM radio, the information is encoded in the amplitude of the carrier wave. Because of this, any noise that alters the amplitude affects the signal, making it more susceptible to interference. Noise in the AM signal is treated as part of the original signal because it changes the amplitude, which is where the information is encoded.
2. **FM Radio (Frequency Modulation)**: In FM radio, the information is contained in variations of frequency rather than amplitude. FM receivers are designed to disregard changes in amplitude, focusing only on frequency variations. This makes FM more resistant to noise because noise usually introduces changes in amplitude, which FM effectively ignores.
Therefore, FM radio frequencies (option B) provide a clearer, less noisy listening experience compared to AM radio frequencies. 
Considering this information, the correct answer to the question "Which radio frequency should you listen to if you want less noise?" is:
B. fm

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. fm

Q: support:             The pioneer species is soon replaced by other populations. Abiotic factors such as soil quality, water, and climate will determine the species that continue the process of succession. Mosses and grasses will be able to grow in the newly created soil. During early succession, plant species like grasses that grow and reproduce quickly will take over the landscape. Over time, these plants improve the soil and a few shrubs can begin to grow. Slowly, the shrubs are replaced by small trees. Small trees then are succeeded by larger trees. Since trees are more successful at competing for resources than shrubs and grasses, a forest may be the end result of primary succession.             question:             What's the term for the gradual progression from simple plants to larger more complex ones in an area?             options:             ['A. pattern progression', 'B. primary pattern', 'C. complex progression', 'D. primary succession']
A: Let's think step by step.
To identify the correct term for the gradual progression from simple plants to larger, more complex ones in an area, we need to evaluate each of the options given and how they relate to the passage.
1. **A. pattern progression** - The passage does not mention "pattern progression" as a related term. This option seems to be a generic term that doesn't specifically apply to ecological succession.
2. **B. primary pattern** - Similarly, "primary pattern" is not mentioned or explained in the passage as a relevant term. It also doesn't specifically relate to ecological succession.
3. **C. complex progression** - While this might seem similar to the concept described, it is not the established scientific term for the process of succession as described in the passage.
4. **D. primary succession** - The passage describes a process starting with pioneer species and moving to larger and more complex ones, culminating in a forest. This is known as "primary succession," where life begins in an area with no soil, gradually leading to the development of an ecosystem such as a forest.
Given the context of the passage and the typical terms used in ecology, the correct answer is **D. primary succession**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is **D. primary succession**.

Q: support:             The pressure of the earth’s atmosphere, as with any fluid, increases with the height of the column of air. In the case of earth’s atmosphere, there are some complications. The density of the air is not uniform but decreases with altitude. Additionally there is no distinct top surface from which height can be measured. We can, however, calculate the approximate difference in pressure between two altitudes using the equation . The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 1.013 × 10 5 Pa. This pressure is often expressed as 101.3 kPa.             question:             What happens to the density of air as the altitude decreases?             options:             ['A. remains the same', 'B. increases', 'C. decreases', 'D. multiplies']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what happens to the density of air as the altitude decreases, we need to consider the relationship between air density and altitude.
1. **Understanding Air Density and Altitude**: 
   - Air density is the mass of air per unit volume. 
   - As altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure decreases because the weight of the air column above is less.
   - Consequently, at higher altitudes, air is less compressed and therefore less dense.
2. **Looking at Decreasing Altitude**:
   - When we consider a decrease in altitude, this means moving from a higher altitude to a lower altitude.
   - At lower altitudes, there is more air above exerting pressure, which compresses the air and increases its density.
3. **Conclusion**:
   - As the altitude decreases, the atmospheric pressure increases because of the greater height of the air column above.
   - This increased pressure compresses the air, resulting in an increase in air density.
Therefore, the correct option regarding what happens to the density of air as the altitude decreases is: **B. increases**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. increases'.

Q: support:             Some animals change their depth by changing their density. Recall that things that are denser than their surroundings sink while those that are less dense than their surroundings float. Most fish have a swim bladder, a special sac that is filled with gases from their blood. When the fish's swim bladder is full, it is less dense than the surrounding water and the fish will rise towards the surface. Another property of water that affects lakes is the unique changes in density during phase changes. The density of most substances increases when a liquid becomes a solid. This is not so for water: Solid water is actually less dense than liquid water. It is for this reason that ice floats. Can you imagine a world where ice sank? Lakes would freeze from the bottom up, killing many fish. Frozen water in the Polar Regions would sink and change the ocean levels. The fact that ice floats is essential for the survival of many aquatic ecosystems and ultimately life on Earth. Besides the changes in density, there are other ways in which the phase changes of water have significant impacts. When water is trapped in small cracks in rocks, it will expand as it freezes and break up the rock causing weathering. The transpiration (evaporation) of water from a good-sized tree can move 1800 liters of water out of the ground in a single day. Sublimation, the phase change between solid and gas, is responsible for the formation of frost. As you can see, water has many special properties that make its role in nature unique. It is considered the "universal solvent” because its bipolar molecule enables it to dissolve a wide variety of substances. Water is the only substance that occurs naturally in all three states; solid, liquid, and gas. Water is truly a miracle for life!.             question:             How do some animals change their depth?             options:             ['A. metamorphosis', 'B. by changing their density', 'C. mass migration', 'D. spontaneous mutations']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how some animals change their depth, let's examine the explanation provided in the support text:
1. The support text mentions that some animals change their depth by changing their density. It provides an example of fish using their swim bladder to control their buoyancy. When the swim bladder is filled with gas, the fish's density decreases, allowing it to float upwards. Conversely, when the swim bladder is less full, the fish becomes denser and can sink.
2. The concept of density is further explained, highlighting that objects denser than their surroundings will sink, while objects less dense than their surroundings will float.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- A. Metamorphosis: This is a biological process involving the development and transformation of an organism, not related to changing depth.
- B. By changing their density: This directly aligns with the explanation in the text, where animals, like fish, change their depth by altering their density.
- C. Mass migration: This refers to the movement of groups of animals from one location to another and does not explain depth changes.
- D. Spontaneous mutations: Random changes in DNA, not related to changing depth.
Based on the information provided, the correct answer is:
B. by changing their density

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which phenomenon is crowding out other species and exacerbating other causes of extinction, let's analyze the options:
- A. Climate change: While climate change is a significant factor in species extinction, the question specifically refers to "crowding out," which is more directly associated with population dynamics.
  
- B. Human overpopulation: This directly relates to human population growth leading to habitat encroachment and resource competition with other species, thus crowding them out. Additionally, it exacerbates other extinction pressures by increasing demands on resources, pollution, and habitat destruction.
- C. Human suburbanization: This is a specific form of human expansion but is more limited in scope compared to the broad impact of human overpopulation.
- D. Migration: This typically refers to population movements that can affect ecological balance but doesn't inherently crowd out other species globally.
From this analysis, the phenomenon that directly "crowds out other species" and amplifies all other extinction causes is "B. human overpopulation."

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. human overpopulation.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's analyze the options and the key term in the question.
1. **Dessication**: This refers to the removal of moisture or the process of extreme drying. In biological terms, when an organism loses water content to a great extent, leading to potentially fatal consequences, it is undergoing desiccation.
Now, let's assess each option:
- **A. Depletion**: This is a general term that refers to the reduction in quantity or exhaustion of a substance. While dehydration involves the depletion of body fluids, "depletion" is too broad and not specific to the removal of moisture.
- **B. Dehydration**: This specifically refers to the loss of water or moisture. Dehydration is the process by which an organism loses more fluids than it takes in, leading to insufficient functioning of bodily processes.
- **C. Diarrhea**: This is a condition characterized by frequent and watery bowel movements, which can lead to dehydration, but it is not directly related to desiccation.
- **D. Starvation**: This refers to suffering or death caused by lack of food. While starvation involves lack of nutrients, it doesn't specifically relate to the drying out related to loss of water content.

Q: support:             Internal Respiration Internal respiration is gas exchange that occurs at the level of body tissues (Figure 22.23). Similar to external respiration, internal respiration also occurs as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient. However, the partial pressure gradients are opposite of those present at the respiratory membrane. The partial pressure of oxygen in tissues is low, about 40 mm Hg, because oxygen is continuously used for cellular respiration. In contrast, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood is about 100 mm Hg. This creates a pressure gradient that causes oxygen to dissociate from hemoglobin, diffuse out of the blood, cross the interstitial space, and enter the tissue. Hemoglobin that has little oxygen bound to it loses much of its brightness, so that blood returning to the heart is more burgundy in color. Considering that cellular respiration continuously produces carbon dioxide, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is lower in the blood than it is in the tissue, causing carbon dioxide to diffuse out of the tissue, cross the interstitial fluid, and enter the blood. It is then carried back to the lungs either bound to hemoglobin, dissolved in plasma, or in a converted form. By the time blood returns to the heart, the partial pressure of oxygen has returned to about 40 mm Hg, and the partial pressure.             question:             Internal and external forms of what life process occur as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient?             options:             ['A. metabolism', 'B. photosynthesis', 'C. respiration', 'D. reproduction']
A: Let's think step by step.
The process being described involves gas exchange at the level of body tissues and involves changes in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide. 
1. **Internal Respiration**: The text talks about oxygen diffusing from the blood into the body tissues because of a partial pressure gradient. Oxygen's partial pressure is higher in the blood and lower in the tissues, leading to its diffusion into the tissues.
2. **External Respiration**: Although not detailed in the provided content, external respiration typically refers to the exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the alveoli in the lungs and the blood. This also occurs via simple diffusion driven by partial pressure gradients, with oxygen entering the blood from the lungs and carbon dioxide exiting the blood to the lungs.
Both the internal and external processes referred to are parts of the broader process of respiration. This is a distinct physiological process from metabolism, photosynthesis, or reproduction, none of which have internal and external subprocesses characterized by gas diffusion due to partial pressure gradients in the same way.
Therefore, the internal and external forms of the life process that occur as simple diffusion due to a partial pressure gradient are those of:

The question asks for the common word for potential difference in a circuit. 
1. **Definition Review**: The term "potential difference" refers to the difference in electric potential (also known as voltage) between two points in a circuit. It's a measure of the work needed to move a charge between those points.
2. **Common Terminology**: In circuit terminology, "voltage" is the term that's commonly used to describe potential difference.
3. **Identifying the Correct Option**: Now, let's review the options provided:
   - A. velocity: This term refers to the speed of an object in a particular direction and doesn’t relate to electric potential difference.
   - B. watt: This is a unit of power, representing the rate of energy transfer or consumption.
   - C. voltage: This is the correct term for potential difference.
   - D. frequency: This refers to the rate at which a periodic event occurs, often used in contexts like sound waves or electromagnetic waves, not potential difference.
Therefore, the common word for potential difference in a circuit is "voltage," which corresponds to option C.
Final answer: **C. voltage**

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. voltage

Q: support:             Populations usually grow bigger when they have what they need. How fast they grow depends on birth and death rates. They grow more slowly as they get close to the carrying capacity. This is the biggest population the environment can support.             question:             When populations get close to the carrying capacity, what happens to growth?             options:             ['A. dies', 'B. slows', 'C. spikes', 'D. halts']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to understand the concept of carrying capacity in relation to population growth.
1. **Definition of Carrying Capacity**: Carrying capacity is the maximum population size of a species that an environment can sustain indefinitely, given the available resources such as food, habitat, water, and other necessities.
2. **Population Growth Near Carrying Capacity**: As a population approaches its carrying capacity, the resources become more limited due to the increased demand. This limitation on resources impacts the birth and death rates.
3. **Effects on Birth and Death Rates**: 
   - Birth rates may decrease because the resources (like food and space) are insufficient to support a larger number of offspring.
   - Death rates may increase due to competition for limited resources, leading to higher mortality.
4. **Overall Impact on Growth Rate**: 
   - With the combination of lowered birth rates and increased death rates, the growth rate of the population slows down.
   - The population no longer grows rapidly and stabilizes as it reaches the carrying capacity.
Therefore, when populations get close to the carrying capacity, the overall growth of the population "slows" due to the balancing impact of birth and death rates and resource limitations.
Considering the options given in the question:
-

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. slows'.

Q: support:             Although air can transfer heat rapidly by convection, it is a poor conductor and thus a good insulator. The amount of available space for airflow determines whether air acts as an insulator or conductor. The space between the inside and outside walls of a house, for example, is about 9 cm (3.5 in) —large enough for convection to work effectively. The addition of wall insulation prevents airflow, so heat loss (or gain) is decreased. Similarly, the gap between the two panes of a double-paned window is about 1 cm, which prevents convection and takes advantage of air’s low conductivity to prevent greater loss. Fur, fiber, and fiberglass also take advantage of the low conductivity of air by trapping it in spaces too small to support convection, as shown in the figure. Fur and feathers are lightweight and thus ideal for the protection of animals.             question:             Although air can transfer heat rapidly by convection, it is a poor conductor and thus a good what?             options:             ['A. magnet', 'B. transporter', 'C. insulator', 'D. absorber']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to understand the context of the statement given. The passage discusses the properties of air concerning heat transfer:
1. Air can transfer heat rapidly by convection.
2. However, air is a poor conductor, which means it does not transfer heat well through conduction.
The passage further elaborates that because air is a poor conductor, it acts as a good insulator. Insulators do not easily allow the passage of heat through them. The properties of air as a poor conductor make it suitable for being an insulator, as it prevents heat loss or gain effectively.
Now, let's look at the options provided:
- A. Magnet: This is unrelated to the properties mentioned in the context.
- B. Transporter: This is not correct as the term doesn't fit the context in which air is discussed as a poor conductor.
- C. Insulator: This fits perfectly as the passage explains how air's poor conductivity makes it a good insulator.
- D. Absorber: While "absorber" is generally about taking in energy or substances, it doesn’t fit the specific context of insulation.
Based on the explanation above, the correct answer is:
C. insulator

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. insulator

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand when most plants do not grow. 
1. **Understanding Plant Growth**: Most plants grow continuously during favorable conditions. However, growth can slow down or cease during unfavorable conditions.
2. **Considering Options**: 
   - **A. dormant**: Dormancy is a period when plants temporarily stop growing, usually due to unfavorable environmental conditions like cold or drought.
   - **B. winter**: Many plants enter a dormant phase during the winter due to cold temperatures and reduced sunlight.
   - **C. abnormal**: The term "abnormal" refers to atypical or unusual conditions or growth, but it is not a specific period during which plants generally stop growing.
   - **D. mutant**: "Mutant" refers to an organism or gene that has undergone mutation, which is unrelated to growth periods.
3. **Determining the Most Appropriate Option**: While both "dormant" and "winter" are relevant to periods of reduced growth, "dormant" is more encompassing as plants can enter dormancy in any unfavorable season, not just winter.
Therefore, the correct answer is **A. dormant**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'A. dormant'.

Q: support:             Observations can happen on many scales. You can use a microscope to observe tiny things. You can use a telescope to observe distant things in space. To learn about the effects of climate change, you could observe Earth's surface. How would you make observations of Earth's surface? You could do this from the land surface or from space. Many important observations are made by orbiting satellites. These satellites have a bird's eye view of how the planet is changing ( Figure below ).             question:             What man-made devices in space are used to observe the earth's surface?             options:             ['A. telescopes', 'B. sensors', 'C. crystals', 'D. satellites']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which man-made devices in space are used to observe the Earth's surface, we can analyze each of the options:
A. Telescopes - While telescopes are used to observe distant objects in space such as stars, planets, and galaxies, they are not typically used for observing the Earth's surface from space.
B. Sensors - Sensors are instruments that measure specific types of data. While satellites often carry sensors to gather data about the Earth, sensors themselves are not standalone devices in space used for observation; they are part of the satellite's equipment.
C. Crystals - Crystals are not devices; they are solid materials with a structure characterized by a specific pattern. They are not used in space to observe the Earth's surface.
D. Satellites - Satellites are man-made devices placed in orbit around the Earth, equipped with various instruments (including sensors) to observe and collect data about the Earth's surface and other environmental parameters.
Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
D. Satellites.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. satellites'.

Q: support:             Diseases of the endocrine system are relatively common. An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough hormone. When too much hormone is secreted, it is called hypersecretion. When not enough hormone is secreted, it is called hyposecretion.             question:             An endocrine disease usually involves the secretion of too much or not enough of what?             options:             ['A. sweat', 'B. enzyme', 'C. metabolite', 'D. hormone']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question is about what an endocrine disease usually involves in terms of secretion. From the provided support information, we learn that endocrine diseases are related to the secretion of hormones. Specifically, these diseases occur when there is either hypersecretion (too much hormone) or hyposecretion (not enough hormone) taking place in the body. Therefore, the focus is on the secretion of hormones. 
Now let's examine the options:
- A. sweat: Sweat is not related to endocrine diseases in the context of hormone secretion.
- B. enzyme: Enzymes are biological molecules that catalyze chemical reactions and are not the primary focus of endocrine system issues.
- C. metabolite: Metabolites are products of metabolism and do not directly relate to the description of endocrine system secretions.
- D. hormone: This option matches the description given in the support as being related to endocrine diseases. Hormone secretion is what is affected in endocrine diseases, with either too much or too little being produced.
Thus, the correct answer is:
D. hormone

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. hormone'

Q: support:             For thousands of years, humans have understood that characteristics such as eye color, hair color, or even flower color are passed from one generation to the next. The passing of characteristics from parent to offspring is called heredity . Humans have long been interested in understanding heredity. Many hereditary mechanisms were developed by scholars but were not properly tested or quantified. The scientific study of genetics did not begin until the late 19 th century. In experiments with garden peas, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel described the basic patterns of inheritance. Keep in mind that while we know about DNA and its role as the genetic material, Mendel did not know of the existence of DNA. Nor did he understand the concept of the chromosome or the process of meiosis, and yet, he was still able to correctly describe basic inheritance patterns.             question:             In experiments with garden peas, austrian monk gregor mendel described the basic patterns of what?             options:             ['A. behavior', 'B. color', 'C. inheritance', 'D. preference']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the answer, we need to focus on the key information provided in the given text.
The main point in the provided passage is about how Gregor Mendel, through his experiments with garden peas, contributed to the understanding of heredity. He described the basic patterns related to how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next, which is a fundamental concept in genetics.
The question asks what patterns Mendel described in his experiments. The relevant part of the passage states: "In experiments with garden peas, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel described the basic patterns of inheritance."
Now, let's review the given options:
- A. behavior
- B. color
- C. inheritance
- D. preference
Based on the text, the correct choice is option C, "inheritance," as it directly aligns with Mendel's work on heredity and how traits are passed from parents to offspring.

Q: support:             24.7 Nutrition and Diet Nutrition and diet affect your metabolism. More energy is required to break down fats and proteins than carbohydrates; however, all excess calories that are ingested will be stored as fat in the body. On average, a person requires 1500 to 2000 calories for normal daily activity, although routine exercise will increase that amount. If you ingest more than that, the remainder is stored for later use. Conversely, if you ingest less than that, the energy stores in your body will be depleted. Both the quantity and quality of the food you eat affect your metabolism and can affect your overall health. Eating too much or too little can result in serious medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Vitamins and minerals are essential parts of the diet. They are needed for the proper function of metabolic pathways in the body. Vitamins are not stored in the body, so they must be obtained from the diet or synthesized from precursors available in the diet. Minerals are also obtained from the diet, but they are also stored, primarily in skeletal tissues.             question:             Nutrition and diet affect your metabolism. more energy is required to break down fats and proteins than this?             options:             ['A. carbohydrates', 'B. vitamins', 'C. electrolytes', 'D. minerals']
A: Let's think step by step.
The statement "more energy is required to break down fats and proteins than this" is referring to a comparison between fats and proteins and another type of nutrient. The passage mentions that "more energy is required to break down fats and proteins than carbohydrates." This implies that carbohydrates require less energy to be metabolized compared to fats and proteins.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, let’s analyze the given information step by step:
1. **Understanding the Term "Unsaturated Hydrocarbons":** 
   - Hydrocarbons are compounds made up of only hydrogen and carbon atoms.
   - When a hydrocarbon is unsaturated, it means it has one or more double or triple bonds between the carbon atoms. These are not saturated with hydrogen atoms.
2. **Identifying the Double Bond:** 
   - The question specifies hydrocarbons with at least one double bond between carbon atoms.
3. **Matching with the Options:**
   - Option A: Peptides are short chains of amino acids (not hydrocarbons).
   - Option B: Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts (not hydrocarbons).
   - Option C: Alkenes are indeed hydrocarbons with at least one carbon-carbon double bond.
   - Option D: Amines are organic compounds derived from ammonia (not primarily characterized by carbon double bonds).
4. **Conclusion:** 
   - Based on the information, the correct answer is C. Alkenes, as they are the class of hydrocarbons described in the question.
Therefore, the unsaturated hydrocarbons with at least one double bond between carbon atoms are called "alkenes." The

Q: support:             The adductor muscle that closes the jaw is composed of two muscles in mammals: the temporalis and the masseter. These allow side-to-side movement of the jaw, making chewing possible, which is unique to mammals. Most mammals have heterodont teeth, meaning that they have different types and shapes of teeth rather than just one type and shape of tooth. Most mammals are diphyodonts, meaning that they have two sets of teeth in their lifetime: deciduous or “baby” teeth, and permanent teeth. Other vertebrates are polyphyodonts, that is, their teeth are replaced throughout their entire life. Mammals, like birds, possess a four-chambered heart. Mammals also have a specialized group of cardiac fibers located in the walls of their right atrium called the sinoatrial node, or pacemaker, which determines the rate at which the heart beats. Mammalian erythrocytes (red blood cells) do not have nuclei, whereas the erythrocytes of other vertebrates are nucleated. The kidneys of mammals have a portion of the nephron called the loop of Henle or nephritic loop, which allows mammals to produce urine with a high concentration of solutes, higher than that of the blood. Mammals lack a renal portal system, which is a system of veins that moves blood from the hind or lower limbs and region of the tail to the kidneys. Renal portal systems are present in all other vertebrates except jawless fishes. A urinary bladder is present in all mammals. Mammalian brains have certain characteristics that differ from other vertebrates. In some, but not all mammals, the cerebral cortex, the outermost part of the cerebrum, is highly folded, allowing for a greater surface area than is possible with a smooth cortex. The optic lobes, located in the midbrain, are divided into two parts in mammals, whereas other vertebrates.             question:             A unique characteristic of mammals is the ability to chew, this happens by the temporalis and the masseter allowing what?             options:             ['A.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the unique characteristic of mammals being able to chew, let's analyze the information provided:
1. The adductor muscle that closes the jaw in mammals is made up of two muscles: the temporalis and the masseter.
2. These muscles allow for side-to-side movement of the jaw.
3. This side-to-side movement is what makes chewing possible in mammals, which is a unique trait.
Given these points, the temporalis and the masseter muscles allow for "B. side-to-side movement" of the jaw, which facilitates chewing. Therefore, the correct option is 'B. side-to-side movement'.

Many STIs can also be transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, and breast milk. Therefore, behaviors such as sharing injection or tattoo needles is another way these STIs can spread.             question:             Most of the pathogens that cause stis enter the body through mucous membranes of which organs?             options:             ['A. kidneys', 'B. eyes', 'C. stomach', 'D. reproductive organs']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to focus on the statement provided in the question:
1. "Most of the pathogens that cause STIs enter the body through mucous membranes of the reproductive organs."
From this, we can see that the phrase directly mentions "the reproductive organs" in relation to where most pathogens causing STIs enter the body. The question asks specifically about the organs through which these pathogens enter via mucous membranes.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **A. kidneys**: The kidneys are not mucous membranes and are not mentioned in the context of STI pathogen entry.
- **B. eyes**: While eyes have mucous membranes, they are not mentioned in the context of STI pathogen entry.
- **C. stomach**: The stomach does not relate to the entry point for STI pathogens via mucous membranes.
- **D. reproductive organs**: The statement clearly identifies "reproductive organs" as the entry point through mucous membranes for most STI pathogens.
Based on the identification in the text, option D, "reproductive organs," is the correct answer.
Therefore, the answer is: **D. reproductive organs**.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question about what kind of buds induces branching, we need to consider the biological context typically associated with branching in plants. In botany, branching is usually related to the growth patterns of plants and trees.
1. **Understanding the options:** 
   - A. arterial buds: This term does not relate to plant biology, as "arterial" is associated with arteries in animals.
   - B. axillary buds: These are buds that form in the axil of a leaf and are a well-known part of plants. They can develop into a branch or flower, leading to the lateral growth of the plant.
   - C. lymphatic buds: Similar to "arterial," "lymphatic" relates to an animal's lymph system, not to plant branching.
   - D. leafy buds: Although "leafy" suggests plant components, this term is not specific to explaining branching patterns.
2. **Identifying the correct type of bud:** 
   - Axillary buds are recognized in plant biology as structures that contribute to the formation of branches. They are located at the junction where a leaf attaches to the stem, known as the axil, and their activation is what leads to the growth of branches.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B

Q: support:             All alkanes are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and have similar bonds, structures, and formulas; noncyclic alkanes all have a formula of CnH2n+2. The number of carbon atoms present in an alkane has no limit. Greater numbers of atoms in the molecules will lead to stronger intermolecular attractions (dispersion forces) and correspondingly different physical properties of the molecules. Properties such as melting point and boiling point (Table 20.1) usually change smoothly and predictably as the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecules change. Properties of Some Alkanes[3] Alkane.             question:             All alkanes are composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, and have similar bonds, structures, and formulas; noncyclic alkanes all have a formula of cnh2n+2. the number of carbon atoms present in an alkane has what?             options:             ['A. such limit', 'B. crippling limit', 'C. done limit', 'D. no limit']

Q: support:             Male Reproductive System Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a condition in which a man has difficulty either initiating or maintaining an erection. The combined prevalence of minimal, moderate, and complete ED is approximately 40 percent in men at age 40, and reaches nearly 70 percent by 70 years of age. In addition to aging, ED is associated with diabetes, vascular disease, psychiatric disorders, prostate disorders, the use of some drugs such as certain antidepressants, and problems with the testes resulting in low testosterone concentrations. These physical and emotional conditions can lead to interruptions in the vasodilation pathway and result in an inability to achieve an erection. Recall that the release of NO induces relaxation of the smooth muscles that surround the penile arteries, leading to the vasodilation necessary to achieve an erection. To reverse the process of vasodilation, an enzyme called phosphodiesterase (PDE) degrades a key component of the NO signaling pathway called cGMP. There are several different forms of this enzyme, and PDE type 5 is the type of PDE found in the tissues of the penis. Scientists discovered that inhibiting PDE5 increases blood flow, and allows vasodilation of the penis to occur. PDEs and the vasodilation signaling pathway are found in the vasculature in other parts of the body. In the 1990s, clinical trials of a PDE5 inhibitor called sildenafil were initiated to treat hypertension and angina pectoris (chest pain caused by poor blood flow through the heart). The trial showed that the drug was not effective at treating heart conditions, but many men experienced erection and priapism (erection lasting longer than 4 hours). Because of this, a clinical trial was started to investigate the ability of sildenafil to promote erections in men suffering from ED. In 1998, the FDA approved the drug, marketed as Viagra®. Since approval of the drug, sildenafil and similar PDE inhibitors now generate over a billion dollars a year in sales, and are reported to be effective in treating approximately 70 to 85 percent of cases of ED. Importantly, men with health problems—especially those with cardiac disease taking nitrates—should avoid Viagra or talk to their physician to find out if they are a candidate for the use of this drug, as deaths have been reported for at-risk users.             question:             What percentage of men suffer from some form of erectile dysfunction by age 40?             options:             ['A. approximately 80 percent', 'B. approximately 60 percent', 'C. approximately 40 percent', 'D. approximately 10 percent']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the percentage of men who suffer from some form of erectile dysfunction (ED) by age 40, let's refer to the information provided in the text:
The text states: "The combined prevalence of minimal, moderate, and complete ED is approximately 40 percent in men at age 40..."
Given this information, the correct answer choice from the options provided would be:

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option that secures immovable joints and prevents them from moving, let's carefully analyze the provided statement.
1. The statement says that "Immovable joints allow no movement because the bones at these joints are held securely together by dense collagen." 
2. This directly specifies that "dense collagen" is responsible for holding the bones securely at these joints.
Now, let's match this information with the given options:
- A. light cartilage: This option is incorrect because the statement mentions collagen, not cartilage.
- B. dense collagen: This option is correct because it directly matches the statement describing what holds the bones at immovable joints.
- C. light collagen: This option is incorrect because the statement specifies "dense collagen," not "light collagen."
- D. dense cartilage: This option is incorrect because the statement specifies collagen, not cartilage.
Therefore, the answer is B. dense collagen.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. dense collagen.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify what transform faults are commonly associated with.
1. **Understanding the term "transform faults":**
   - Transform faults are a type of fault in the Earth's crust where two tectonic plates slide past each other.
   - This lateral motion can lead to significant geological activity, particularly earthquakes.
2. **Connecting "transform faults" to the options provided:**
   - A. storms: These are weather-related events and not typically caused by geological faulting.
   - B. earthquakes: This is a geologic event that occurs due to the movement of tectonic plates along faults. Transform faults are well-known for causing earthquakes.
   - C. vibrations: While earthquakes do cause vibrations in the Earth, the more specific term for these significant geologic events is "earthquakes".
   - D. tornadoes: These are meteorological phenomena and not related to tectonic plate movements.
3. **Selecting the best option:**
   - Since transform faults are indeed the site of massive earthquakes, option B ("earthquakes") is the correct answer.
Therefore, the answer is B. earthquakes.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. earthquakes.

However, after equilibrium is attained, the amounts of reactants and products will be constant.             question:             In a chemical reaction, the amounts of reactants and products will be constant when what state is attained?             options:             ['A. saturation', 'B. equilibrium', 'C. peak', 'D. homogeneity']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's consider the behavior of a chemical reaction:
1. In a chemical reaction, reactants are transformed into products over time. During this process, the amounts of reactants decrease while the amounts of products increase.
2. **Equilibrium** is the state in a chemical reaction where the rate of the forward reaction (reactants to products) is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction (products back to reactants). This does not mean that the amounts of reactants and products are equal, but rather that their concentrations remain constant over time because the processes are balanced.
3. At **saturation**, a solution contains the maximum concentration of a solute that can dissolve at a given temperature, which is not related to chemical equilibrium in reactions.
4. **Peak** refers to the highest point of something, often used in different contexts such as peak concentration, but it is not specific to chemical equilibrium.
5. **Homogeneity** is the quality of being uniform throughout, but it does not specifically refer to the constancy of amounts in a chemical reaction.
Considering these definitions, the state at which the amounts of reactants and products remain constant because the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate is:
- **B. equilibrium**
Therefore,

Q: support:             Gravity has traditionally been defined as a force of attraction between things that have mass. According to this conception of gravity, anything that has mass, no matter how small, exerts gravity on other matter. Gravity can act between objects that are not even touching. In fact, gravity can act over very long distances. However, the farther two objects are from each other, the weaker is the force of gravity between them. Less massive objects also have less gravity than more massive objects.             question:             What is the term for the force of attraction between things that have a mass?             options:             ['A. magnetism', 'B. weight', 'C. gravity', 'D. motion']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's first understand the context provided in the support statement. The statement explains that gravity is traditionally defined as a force of attraction between things that have mass. It further elaborates that gravitational force can act over long distances and becomes weaker as the distance between objects increases. Additionally, it mentions that less massive objects exert less gravitational force compared to more massive ones.
Now, let's examine the options provided to identify the correct term for this force of attraction:
- Option A: Magnetism refers to the force of attraction or repulsion that acts at a distance due to the magnetic field. It is not related specifically to the mass of objects but rather involves magnetic materials.
  
- Option B: Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, specifically the gravity of Earth (or any other celestial body). Although related to gravity, weight itself is not the force of attraction; instead, it is the effect of gravity on a mass.
  
- Option C: Gravity, as described in the support statement, is indeed the force of attraction between objects that have mass, acting over distances.
  
- Option D: Motion refers to the change in position of an object over time and is not directly related to the concept of gravitational attraction between masses.
Thus, the appropriate

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C: gravity.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to identify which of the provided options is a long, thin protein extension found in most prokaryotic cells.
1. **Understanding Prokaryotic Cells**: Prokaryotic cells are simple, unicellular organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Examples include bacteria and archaea.
2. **Protein Extensions in Prokaryotic Cells**: Prokaryotic cells often have structures that extend from their cell surface. These are typically used for movement, attachment, or other specialized functions.

To determine the preventive measure that can protect even young children against diseases such as viral meningitis, we need to review the provided support statement and the options given.
1. The support statement mentions that "children as young as 2 years of age can be vaccinated against viral meningitis."
2. The question asks for a preventive measure against diseases like viral meningitis.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: "surgical intervention" - Surgical intervention is typically a treatment method, not a preventive measure for diseases like viral meningitis.
- Option B: "malnutrition" - Malnutrition cannot be considered a preventive measure; rather, it can weaken the immune system, increasing susceptibility to diseases.
- Option C: "nutrition" - While proper nutrition can support general health and the immune system, it is not a specific preventive measure against viral meningitis.
- Option D: "vaccination" - Vaccination is a recognized and specific preventive measure against viral infections, including viral meningitis, as it works by stimulating the body's immune system to protect against the disease.

A: Let's think step by step.
To find the answer, we need to consider the information given in the support statement: "Renal plasma flow equals the blood flow per minute times the hematocrit." Let's break this down:
1. **Renal Plasma Flow:** This refers to the volume of plasma that passes through the kidneys per minute.
2. **Blood Flow per Minute:** This is the volume of blood that passes through the kidneys per minute, typically measured in milliliters (mL/min).
3. **Hematocrit:** This is the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells. It is expressed as a percentage.
Now, analyzing the question: "Renal plasma flow equals the blood flow per minute times the what?"
According to the information provided, renal plasma flow is calculated using the blood flow per minute and something else. The key here is to match this "something else" with the options provided.
Given the statement, "Renal plasma flow equals the blood flow per minute times the hematocrit," this directly identifies hematocrit as the missing component in the question.

Q: support:             Lattice energy of an ionic solid is a measure of the strength of bonds in that ionic compound.             question:             What does lattice energy of an ionic solid measure the strength of?             options:             ['A. metals', 'B. electrons', 'C. bonds', 'D. atoms']
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what lattice energy measures, we should first consider what lattice energy itself is. Lattice energy is a measure related to ionic compounds. It indicates the amount of energy required to completely separate a mole of a solid ionic compound into its gaseous ions. Essentially, it reflects the strength of the electrostatic forces (ionic bonds) holding the ions together in the lattice structure of the solid.
Now, let's consider the options provided:
- **A. metals**: Lattice energy specifically pertains to ionic solids, not metals. Metals are not held together by ionic bonds.
- **B. electrons**: Lattice energy isn't about measuring the strength of electrons themselves; it's about the bonds between ions, which involve electron interactions, but indirectly.
- **C. bonds**: This option makes the most sense, as lattice energy is indeed a measure of the strength of the ionic bonds within the ionic lattice. It indicates how strongly the ions are bound together.
- **D. atoms**: While atoms comprise molecules or lattices, lattice energy specifically refers to the ionic bonds, not the atoms themselves.
Thus, the correct option is "C. bonds", as lattice energy measures the strength of the bonds (or electrostatic forces) in an ionic compound.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. bonds

A: Let's think step by step.
Taste buds are specialized sensory structures on the tongue that detect different tastes. Traditionally, it was believed that there are four primary tastes: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. However, a fifth taste, umami, which is the taste of savory or meaty flavors, was identified and has been widely accepted. 
Therefore, based on current scientific understanding, taste buds can detect five primary types of taste. 
The correct answer is: B. five

A: Let's think step by step.
Titration is a laboratory technique used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution by reacting it with a solution of known concentration. In the context of acids and bases, titration involves using a solution of known concentration, called the titrant, to react with the analyte, an unknown acid or base.
1. **Purpose of Titration:**
   - Titration is specifically used to find the concentration of an unknown solution. The process involves a chemical reaction between the titrant (of known concentration) and the analyte (of unknown concentration).
2. **Options Analysis:**
   - A. Alkalinity: While titration can help measure alkalinity in specific situations involving bases, it is not the general specific purpose of all titrations related to both acids and bases.
   - B. Concentration: This directly corresponds to the primary purpose of titration, which is the determination of the concentration of an unknown solution.
   - C. Maturation: This is unrelated to the process of titration. Maturation refers to the process of aging or bringing something to full development and is not relevant in the context of titration.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which factor has led to the evolution of alternative male mating behavior and morphology in some species, we must consider the mechanisms that drive evolutionary changes, particularly in reproductive strategies.
1. **Distributive Selection (A)**: This term is not typically used in evolutionary biology. The term "disruptive selection," however, is known, where extreme values for a trait are favored over intermediate values, potentially leading to a split in the population.
2. **Similar Selection (B)**: This is not a recognized evolutionary term or concept in the context of mating behaviors or morphology.
3. **Sexual Selection (C)**: This is a key mechanism of evolution, proposed by Darwin, where certain traits increase an individual's chances of mating and reproducing. Sexual selection can lead to varying mating behaviors and morphologies, particularly between males and females (sexual dimorphism) or among males (alternative mating strategies).
4. **Sexual Process (D)**: This term is vague and not standard in evolutionary biology when discussing mating behavior and morphology evolution.
Based on these evaluations, the most relevant and scientifically accurate answer is:
C. sexual selection

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. sexual selection

We don’t have to drill for it or pump it to the surface. We just need to install solar panels like the ones in Figure below and let sunlight strike them. The energy from the sunlight is changed to electricity. The electricity is used to power lights and appliances in the house. So solar energy doesn't have to be transported.             question:             What renewable energy source converts energy from the sunlight into electricity?             options:             ['A. geophysical energy', 'B. geothermal energy', 'C. hydrostatic energy', 'D. solar energy']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks which renewable energy source converts sunlight into electricity. From the support information, we know that solar energy involves the use of solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. 
Let's go through the options:
- A. Geophysical energy: This is not related to converting sunlight into electricity.
- B. Geothermal energy: This involves using heat from the Earth, not sunlight.
- C. Hydrostatic energy: This term is not commonly used in the context of renewable energy, but it doesn't refer to converting sunlight into electricity.

Q: support:             Arteries Serving the Upper Limbs As the subclavian artery exits the thorax into the axillary region, it is renamed the axillary artery. Although it does branch and supply blood to the region near the head of the humerus (via the humeral circumflex arteries), the majority of the vessel continues into the upper arm, or brachium, and becomes the brachial artery (Figure 20.31). The brachial artery supplies blood to much of the brachial region and divides at the elbow into several smaller branches, including the deep brachial arteries, which provide blood to the posterior surface of the arm, and the ulnar collateral arteries, which supply blood to the region of the elbow. As the brachial artery approaches the coronoid fossa, it bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries, which continue into the forearm, or antebrachium. The radial artery and ulnar artery parallel their namesake bones, giving off smaller branches until they reach the wrist, or carpal region. At this level, they fuse to form the superficial and deep palmar arches that supply blood to the hand, as well as the digital arteries that supply blood to the digits. Figure 20.32 shows the distribution of systemic arteries from the heart into the upper limb. Table 20.9 summarizes the arteries serving the upper limbs.             question:             The radial artery and which artery parallel their namesake bones, giving off smaller branches until they reach the wrist, or carpal region?             options:             ['A. biceps', 'B. triceps', 'C. ulnar', 'D. humerus']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking which artery, along with the radial artery, parallels its namesake bone and gives off smaller branches until it reaches the wrist or carpal region.
1. The radial artery is named after the radius bone in the forearm, which it parallels.
2. According to the information provided, the brachial artery bifurcates into the radial and another artery as it approaches the coronoid fossa.
3. The text indicates that the radial artery and another artery continue into the forearm and parallel their respective namesake bones.
4. This other artery is the ulnar artery, which parallels the ulna bone.
Thus, the correct answer is C. ulnar.

Meristem is a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate. Meristem at the tips of roots and stems allows them to grow in length. This is called primary growth. Meristem within and around vascular tissues allows growth in width. This is called secondary growth.             question:             What is the name of the type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate?             options:             ['A. bundle sheth cell', 'B. guard cell', 'C. cuticle', 'D. meristem']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the plant tissue made up of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide and differentiate.
1. **Understanding the Information**:
   - The statement mentions a type of plant tissue called "meristem."
   - It describes meristem as having undifferentiated cells capable of division and differentiation.
   
2. **Analyzing the Question**:
   - The question asks for the name of the plant tissue with these characteristics.
3. **Considering the Options**:
   - "A. bundle sheath cell" refers to a type of cell surrounding vascular bundles, not undifferentiated.
   - "B. guard cell" is involved in controlling the opening and closing of stomata, not undifferentiated.
   - "C. cuticle" is a protective film covering the epidermis of leaves, young shoots, and other aerial plant organs, not undifferentiated cells.
   - "D. meristem" is consistent with the description of tissue made of undifferentiated cells that can divide and differentiate.
Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is **D. meristem**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. meristem.

Q: support:             The Phosphorus Cycle Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for living processes; it is a major component of nucleic acids and phospholipids, and, as calcium phosphate, makes up the supportive components of our bones. Phosphorus is often the limiting nutrient (necessary for growth) in aquatic, particularly freshwater, ecosystems. Phosphorus occurs in nature as the phosphate ion (PO43-). In addition to phosphate runoff as a result of human activity, natural surface runoff occurs when it is leached from phosphate-containing rock by weathering, thus sending phosphates into rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This rock has its origins in the ocean. Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions. However, volcanic ash, aerosols, and mineral dust may also be significant phosphate sources. This sediment then is moved to land over geologic time by the uplifting of Earth’s surface. (Figure 20.13) Phosphorus is also reciprocally exchanged between phosphate dissolved in the ocean and marine organisms. The movement of phosphate from the ocean to the land and through the soil is extremely slow, with the average phosphate ion having an oceanic residence time between 20,000 and 100,000 years.             question:             Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their what?             options:             ['A. ancestors', 'B. blood', 'C. excretions', 'D. skeletons']
A: Let's think step by step.
To address the question, we need to find where the information related to the formation of phosphate-containing ocean sediments is discussed in the given text. Here's the relevant sentence from the text:
"Phosphate-containing ocean sediments form primarily from the bodies of ocean organisms and from their excretions."
The key phrase here is "and from their excretions," which directly answers the question about what else, besides their bodies, contributes to the formation of these sediments. Now, let's look at the provided options to find the correct one:
- A. ancestors
- B. blood
- C. excretions
- D. skeletons
According to the sentence, the correct answer is "C. excretions."

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what erosion does to pieces of broken rock, let's analyze the options:
1. **A. Cancel Them**: This doesn't make sense in the context of what erosion does. Erosion doesn't cancel rocks; it affects them physically.
2. **B. Moves Them**: This option aligns perfectly with the statement "Erosion moves the pieces of broken rock." Erosion involves processes like water, wind, or ice transporting sediment and rocks from one place to another.
3. **C. Smooth Them**: While erosion can smooth rocks over time, the specific statement we're considering emphasizes movement rather than smoothing. This is more of a secondary effect of erosion.
4. **D. Lead Them**: This isn't a typical way to describe the action of erosion. Erosion doesn't lead rocks but physically moves them.
Based on this breakdown, the best choice is **B. moves them**, as it directly correlates with how erosion is described in the support statement.

Q: support:             If you’re like Tanya in this picture, you prefer your iced tea sweetened with sugar. Sweetened iced tea is a solution in which solid sugar (the solute) is dissolved in cold liquid tea, which is mostly water (the solvent). When you add sugar to tea, particles of water pull apart particles of sugar. The particles of sugar spread throughout the tea, making all of it taste sweet.             question:             In a glass of sweet tea the sugar is known as the solute and the water is known as what?             options:             ['A. pigment', 'B. solvent', 'C. solid', 'D. calcium']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's review the definitions of the terms involved:
- **Solute**: This is the substance that is dissolved in another substance. In this case, sugar is the solute because it is being dissolved in the tea.
- **Solvent**: This is the substance that does the dissolving. In a typical liquid solution, the solvent is the liquid that dissolves the solute. In sweetened iced tea, water is the primary component of the tea and acts as the solvent that dissolves the sugar.
Now, referring to the options provided in the question:
- **A. Pigment**: A pigment is a substance that imparts color. This is not related to the concept of a solvent.
- **B. Solvent**: As explained, the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. In this scenario, water is indeed the solvent.
- **C. Solid**: While sugar as the solute is initially a solid, the solvent is a liquid, not a solid.
- **D. Calcium**: Calcium is a chemical element, not relevant to the function of a solvent in this context.
Considering these definitions and the process described, the correct answer is:
**B. Solvent**

Q: support:             can occur in electrolytic cells by introducing a power supply, which supplies the energy to force the electrons to flow in the nonspontaneous direction. Electrolysis is done in solutions, which contain enough ions so current can flow. If the solution contains only one material, like the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, it is a simple matter to determine what is oxidized and what is reduced. In more complicated systems, like the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride, more than one species can be oxidized or reduced and the standard reduction potentials are used to determine the most likely oxidation (the half-reaction with the largest [most positive] standard reduction potential) and reduction (the half-reaction with the smallest [least positive] standard reduction potential). Sometimes unexpected half-reactions occur because of overpotential. Overpotential is the difference between the theoretical half-reaction reduction potential and the actual voltage required. When present, the applied potential must be increased, making it possible for a different reaction to occur in the electrolytic cell. The total charge, Q, that passes through an electrolytic cell can be expressed as the current (I) multiplied by time (Q = It) or as the moles of electrons (n) multiplied by Faraday’s constant (Q = nF). These relationships can be used to determine things like the amount of material used or generated during electrolysis, how long the reaction must proceed, or what value of the current is required.             question:             The difference between the theoretical half-reaction reduction potential and the actual voltage required is called what?             options:             ['A. overpotential', 'B. excess', 'C. overcharge', 'D. resistance']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify the term that defines the difference between the theoretical half-reaction reduction potential and the actual voltage required. 
The passage provides a definition stating: 
> "Sometimes unexpected half-reactions occur because of overpotential. Overpotential is the difference between the theoretical half-reaction reduction potential and the actual voltage required."
From this direct information, we can see that the correct term is already explicitly mentioned: "overpotential."
Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. overpotential

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'A. overpotential'

Q: support:             While the egg is developing, other changes are taking place in the uterus. It develops a thick lining that is full of tiny blood vessels. The lining prepares the uterus to receive a fertilized egg if fertilization actually takes place.             question:             While the egg is developing, other changes are taking place in the uterus. it develops a thick lining that is full of what?             options:             ['A. large arteries', 'B. amniotic fluid', 'C. tiny blood vessels', 'D. white blood cells']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we'll break down the information provided:
1. **Statement Analysis**: 
   - The provided information states, "While the egg is developing, other changes are taking place in the uterus. It develops a thick lining that is full of tiny blood vessels."
   - This indicates that during the development of the egg, the uterus changes to prepare for potential fertilization. Specifically, it develops a lining filled with something.
2. **Question Examination**:
   - The question asks, "While the egg is developing, other changes are taking place in the uterus. It develops a thick lining that is full of what?"
   - This question is directly asking for what fills the thick lining that develops in the uterus.
3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A. large arteries**: Large arteries are not typically associated with the uterine lining during this stage.
   - **B. amniotic fluid**: Amniotic fluid is related to the fetus's development, not the uterine lining itself during egg development.
   - **C. tiny blood vessels**: The original statement specifically mentions "tiny blood vessels" in the context of the uterine lining development. This matches perfectly.
   - **D. white blood cells**:

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. tiny blood vessels

If the signaling by growth factors were disrupted, then the entire ectoderm would differentiate into neural tissue. The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the neural tube, as illustrated in Figure 43.28. In further development, the neural tube will give rise to the brain and the spinal cord.             question:             The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called what?             options:             ['A. neural tube', 'B. cell tube', 'C. peripheral tube', 'D. occular tube']

Q: support:             Small nonpolar molecules can easily diffuse across the cell membrane. However, due to the hydrophobic nature of the lipids that make up cell membranes, polar molecules (such as water) and ions cannot do so. Instead, they diffuse across the membrane through transport proteins. A transport protein completely spans the membrane, and allows certain molecules or ions to diffuse across the membrane. Channel proteins, gated channel proteins, and carrier proteins are three types of transport proteins that are involved in facilitated diffusion.             question:             Due to the __________ nature of the lipids that make up cell membranes, polar molecules (such as water) and ions cannot easily diffuse across the cell membrane.             options:             ['A. saturated', 'B. hydrophobic', 'C. hydrophylic', 'D. catalytic']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to determine which word correctly fills in the blank about the nature of the lipids that make up cell membranes.
1. **Understanding the Sentence**: The statement is referring to a characteristic of lipids that prevents polar molecules and ions from easily diffusing across the cell membrane. 
2. **Characteristics of Lipids**: Lipids in cell membranes are known to be hydrophobic, meaning they repel water. This is why polar molecules, which are hydrophilic (water-attracting), cannot easily pass through the membrane.
3. **Eliminating Incorrect Options**:
   - **A. saturated**: Saturated refers to the type of fatty acids in lipids, specifically having no double bonds between carbon atoms. This is not relevant to the question about diffusion.
   - **C. hydrophylic**: Hydrophilic means water-attracting, which is the opposite of what prevents polar molecules from diffusing across the membrane.
   - **D. catalytic**: Catalytic refers to a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. This is not relevant to the nature of lipid membranes.
4. **Correct Option**: 
   - **B. hydrophobic**: This is the

Q: support:             Vertebrates reproduce sexually, and almost all have separate male and female sexes. Aquatic species generally have external fertilization, whereas terrestrial species usually have internal fertilization. Vertebrates have one of three reproductive strategies, known as ovipary, ovovivipary, or vivipary.             question:             In what way do all vertebrates reproduce?             options:             ['A. sexually', 'B. mitosis', 'C. biologically', 'D. asexually']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how all vertebrates reproduce, we should refer to the information provided in the support statement. The statement explicitly mentions that "vertebrates reproduce sexually," indicating that sexual reproduction is a common characteristic of all vertebrates. As we compare this information to the given options:
- Option A: "sexually" directly matches what is mentioned in the support statement.
- Option B: "mitosis" is a form of cell division, not a reproductive strategy for whole organisms.
- Option C: "biologically" is too broad as all life processes are biological; it doesn't specifically describe the method of reproduction.
- Option D: "asexually" contradicts the support statement, as it specifies sexual reproduction.
Therefore, the correct answer is option A: sexually.

A: Let's think step by step.
When high temperature is applied to cells, the heat causes the proteins within the cells to denature. Denaturing is when proteins lose their natural structure due to external stress or compound, such as heat. Once the proteins are denatured, they can no longer perform their biological functions properly, which can lead to cell dysfunction or death.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- A. finds them: High temperature does not "find" cells.
- B. kills them: High temperature can indeed kill cells as a result of protein denaturation and other heat-induced damage.
- C. exposes them: High temperature does not "expose" cells in this context.
- D. develops them: High temperature does not "develop" cells; it actually damages them.
Based on the explanation, the correct answer is:
B. kills them

Q: support:             A cell membrane is essentially a mixture of phospholipids that form a phospholipid bilayer. One definition of a cell is a collection of molecules surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer that is capable of reproducing itself. The simplest cells are bacteria, which consist of only a single compartment surrounded by a single membrane. Animal and plant cells are much more complex, however, and contain many different kinds of compartments, each surrounded by a membrane and able to carry out specialized tasks.             question:             What term is used to describe a collection of molecules surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer that is capable of reproducing itself?             options:             ['A. atom', 'B. cell', 'C. proteins', 'D. organism']
A: Let's think step by step.
To identify the correct term, we should refer to the definition provided in the support text. The text states that "a cell is a collection of molecules surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer that is capable of reproducing itself."
Now let's evaluate the given options:
- A. atom: An atom is the basic unit of a chemical element and does not fit the description provided.
- B. cell: The definition of a cell matches the description in the support text, making this a strong candidate.
- C. proteins: Proteins are large molecules composed of amino acids, and they do not fit the description as they are not collections of molecules capable of reproducing themselves.
- D. organism: An organism is a living being, which might be made of one or many cells, but it is more complex than just a collection of molecules surrounded by a bilayer.

Q: support:             Role of Feedback Loops The contribution of feedback loops to homeostasis will only be briefly reviewed here. Positive feedback loops are characterized by the release of additional hormone in response to an original hormone release. The release of oxytocin during childbirth is a positive feedback loop. The initial release of oxytocin begins to signal the uterine muscles to contract, which pushes the fetus toward the cervix, causing it to stretch. This, in turn, signals the pituitary gland to release more oxytocin, causing labor contractions to intensify. The release of oxytocin decreases after the birth of the child. The more common method of hormone regulation is the negative feedback loop. Negative feedback is characterized by the inhibition of further secretion of a hormone in response to adequate levels of that hormone. This allows blood levels of the hormone to be regulated within a narrow range. An example of a negative feedback loop is the release of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal glands, as directed by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. As glucocorticoid concentrations in the blood rise, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland reduce their signaling to the adrenal glands to prevent additional glucocorticoid secretion (Figure 17.6).             question:             By allowing blood levels of a hormone to be regulated within a narrow range, feedback loops contribute to maintaining what state?             options:             ['A. homeostasis', 'B. hypothesis', 'C. hibernation', 'D. consciousness']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to understand what is being asked. The question focuses on the role of feedback loops in regulating hormone levels within a narrow range and their contribution to maintaining a certain state.
1. **Understanding Feedback Loops**: The context provided describes two types of feedback loops: positive and negative. Positive feedback loops increase the release of a hormone, as seen with oxytocin during childbirth. Negative feedback loops inhibit further secretion when hormone levels are adequate, which helps maintain stability in the body.
2. **Role of Feedback Loops**: Feedback loops, particularly negative ones, help maintain stable conditions in the body by controlling hormone levels. This process of maintaining stability is essential for the body's internal environment.
3. **Identifying the State**: The stable state maintained through these regulatory mechanisms is known as "homeostasis." Homeostasis refers to the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment suitable for sustaining life, including regulating temperature, pH, and hormone levels.
Now, let's look at the options provided:
- A. homeostasis
- B. hypothesis
- C. hibernation
- D. consciousness
4. **Selecting the Correct Option**: Given the explanation, the state that feedback loops contribute to by regulating blood hormone levels within a

Q: support:             Connective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance Three main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen fiber is made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while flexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience and strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body. Elastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main property of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are prominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column. Reticular fiber is also formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain narrow and are arrayed in a branching network. They are found throughout the body, but are most abundant in the reticular tissue of soft organs, such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the parenchyma (the functional cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ). All of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by fibroblasts, ground substance is made of polysaccharides, specifically hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with a protein core and.             question:             Collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers comprise what type of tissue?             options:             ['A. connective tissue', 'B. skin tissue', 'C. intestine tissue', 'D. nucleus tissue']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which type of tissue is comprised of collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers, let's analyze the properties and functions listed for each type of fiber:
1. **Collagen fibers** are described as having great tensile strength, resisting stretching, and providing resilience and strength to ligaments and tendons. This suggests that they contribute to the structural support necessary for the connective roles these tissues play in the body.
2. **Elastic fibers** contain elastin, allowing them to return to their original shape after being stretched or compressed. They are prominent in tissues that require elasticity, like the skin and elastic ligaments of the vertebral column, which implies support and flexibility.
3. **Reticular fibers** form narrow, branching networks and provide structural support in soft organs like the liver and spleen. This supports their role in maintaining the framework for cellular components in organs.
These fibers are components that contribute to the structural framework of tissues within the body and are embedded in ground substance, providing elasticity, strength, and support.
Given this information, the fibers support the structure and function of tissue that provides a supportive framework for the body and its organs. Therefore, the fibers are characteristic of **connective tissue**, which has functions including supporting and connecting other tissues and organs in the

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'A. connective tissue'.

To solve this question, let's first examine the information provided:
1. The question asks for the name of the disease where some of the alveoli of the lungs fill with fluid, preventing gas exchange.
2. The support statement clearly defines pneumonia as a disease characterized by alveoli filling with fluid, leading to symptoms such as coughing, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and fatigue.
3. We have four options to choose from:
   - A. lung cancer
   - B. emphysema
   - C. leukemia
   - D. pneumonia
4. From the support statement, it's clear that pneumonia fits the description provided in the question about the condition where the alveoli fill with fluid.

The behavior of two groups that live in the same region is an example of such separation. The separation may be caused by different mating seasons, for example. Sympatric speciation is more difficult to identify.             question:             What occurs when groups from the same species stop mating because of something other than physical or geographic separation?             options:             ['A. complementary speciation', 'B. invasive speciation', 'C. sympatric speciation', 'D. extinction']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to identify which term describes the phenomenon where groups from the same species cease mating due to factors other than physical or geographic separation. 
1. The question provides a definition and context for this concept: when groups from the same species stop mating due to reasons other than physical or geographic barriers, such as differing behaviors or mating seasons even when living in the same area.
2. We are given the term "sympatric speciation" in the support text, which describes exactly this phenomenon: the formation of new species within the same geographic area, without physical separation, but instead due to differences like behavior or mating time.
3. Now, let's match this with the options given:
   - A. complementary speciation: This term is not commonly used in evolutionary biology and does not match the concept described.
   - B. invasive speciation: This refers to species that invade new areas and is not related to changes within a local population.
   - C. sympatric speciation: This aligns perfectly with the definition provided, where speciation occurs without physical separation.
   - D. extinction: This refers to the complete disappearance of a species and is unrelated to speciation dynamics.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, let's analyze the information provided:
1. **Definition of Autotrophs:** Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own glucose through the process of photosynthesis. Examples include plants, algae, and some types of bacteria. Autotrophs are referred to as "self feeders."
2. **Definition of Heterotrophs:** Heterotrophs are organisms that obtain glucose by consuming autotrophs or by consuming other organisms that have eaten autotrophs. Essentially, they rely on others for food, hence the term "other feeders."

Q: support:             Introduction Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires energy. Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use energy while thinking, and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported into the cell, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and possibly distributed to the entire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are built from smaller molecules imported from dietary amino acids. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport of molecules into and out of cells. In addition, processes such as ingesting and breaking down pathogenic bacteria and viruses, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the cell require energy. From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. This chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed with great efficiency.             question:             Virtually every task performed by living organisms requires this?             options:             ['A. mineral', 'B. energy', 'C. metals', 'D. solids']

Q: support:                          question:             The binding of what helps eliminate antigens by phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis             options:             ['A. amino acids', 'B. antibodies', 'C. proteins', 'D. fats']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's evaluate each option:
A. Amino acids: These are the building blocks of proteins but don't directly function in immune responses like eliminating antigens through phagocytosis or complement-mediated lysis.
B. Antibodies: These are protein molecules produced by the immune system that specifically bind to antigens. The binding of antibodies to antigens marks them for destruction and facilitates their elimination through phagocytosis by immune cells and complement-mediated lysis, a process where the complement system forms pores in the membrane of pathogens, leading to their destruction.
C. Proteins: While antibodies are proteins, the term is too broad and not specific to the mechanism described in the question. Many proteins have various functions in the body.
D. Fats: These are not involved in the immune response mechanisms described. Fats serve as energy storage and have structural roles in the body but do not help with antigen elimination through the processes mentioned.
Considering the explanation, the correct answer is:
B. Antibodies

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. Antibodies

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the anatomy and physiology involved in the gill ventilation process of aquatic animals, such as fish.
1. **Function of Gills:** Gills are the respiratory organs in fish and other aquatic animals, responsible for extracting oxygen from water and excreting carbon dioxide.
2. **Mechanism of Water Flow:** Fish employ a mechanism to pump water over their gills. This is crucial for maintaining a continuous flow of water, allowing effective gas exchange.
3. **Muscles Involved in Pumping Water:**
   - The primary muscles involved in creating the suction needed to draw water over the gills are located around the gill region.
   - The pharyngeal muscles play a significant role, as they assist in expanding and contracting the pharynx to move water.
4. **Role of Jaws:** The movements of the mouth and the opening and closing of the jaws also facilitate the flow of water into the mouth and over the gills. 
5. **Eliminating Incorrect Options:**
   - "A. pharynx and tonsils" - Tonsils are not involved in a fish's respiratory process.
   - "C. lungs and pharynx" - Fish do not have lungs

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is **D. jaws and pharynx**.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to focus on the information provided in the support text.
The support text states: "Lipids are made of long chains consisting almost solely of carbon and hydrogen. These long chains are called fatty acids."
From this, we can deduce the following:
- The support text clearly mentions that lipids are made of long chains.
- It specifies that these long chains consist almost solely of carbon and hydrogen.
- These long chains are specifically referred to as fatty acids.
Now let's evaluate the options provided:
- A. Lipids: This matches the description given in the support text as the correct answer, because the text clearly states that lipids are made of these long-carbon-hydrogen chains.
- B. Proteins: Proteins are made up of amino acids, which consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sometimes sulfur, but are not described as long chains of carbon and hydrogen.
- C. Enzymes: Enzymes are a type of protein and are therefore made up of amino acids, not long chains of carbon and hydrogen.
- D. Nucleic acids: These are composed of nucleotides, which contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, but not long chains of carbon and

Q: support:             0 .033 g 1 .117 g × 100 = 3 .0% When a series of measurements is precise but not accurate, the error is usually systematic. Systematic errors can be caused by faulty instrumentation or faulty technique. The difference between accuracy and precision is demonstrated in Skill Builder ES7.             question:             When a series of measurements is precise but not what, the error is usually systematic?             options:             ['A. length', 'B. velocity', 'C. color', 'D. accurate']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify the part of the text that addresses the nature of the error when measurements are discussed in terms of precision and accuracy.
1. The statement begins with a series of measurements being precise but not something else. We need to fill in what the "something else" is that these measurements are not.
2. It states that when they are precise but not this other quality, the error is usually systematic.
3. Systematic errors are typically due to faulty instrumentation or technique, implying a consistent deviation from the true value.
4. The difference between accuracy and precision is highlighted, suggesting these are the two key qualities being contrasted.
5. Precision refers to how close repeated measurements are to each other, while accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true value.
From this information, the right choice should explain that measurements lacking this quality while being precise have systematic errors.
Now, looking at the options:
- 'A. length' is not a characteristic related to measurements in terms of error.
- 'B. velocity' is a type of measurement, not a quality of measurement like precision or accuracy.
- 'C. color' is irrelevant in terms of discussing measurement precision or accuracy.
- 'D. accurate' fits the context because it's

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. accurate'. When a series of measurements is precise but not accurate, the error is usually systematic.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we can break it down and use the context given in the support statement.
1. **Understanding the Definition**: The support statement explains a process where copies of a normal gene are inserted into a patient with a defective gene. This process is specifically referred to as "gene therapy."
2. **Identifying the Key Term**: The key term we're looking for is the name of this process, which the support statement directly identifies as "gene therapy."
3. **Verifying with Options**: We should check this against the given options:
   - Option A: "gene therapy" aligns perfectly with the process described in the support statement.
   - Options B, C, and D: These do not match the description from the support statement. "Cloning" is not the insertion of genes into humans; "pattern therapy" and "chromosome treatment" are not standard terms used for such a genetic procedure.
Thus, the correct answer is:
- **A. gene therapy**
By going through these steps, we can confidently conclude that "Inserting copies of normal genes into a patient with defective genes" is indeed known as "gene therapy."

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. gene therapy

A: Let's think step by step.
During times of environmental stress, organisms often engage in sexual reproduction rather than asexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two parents, which can increase genetic diversity and improve the adaptability of the offspring to changing or stressful environments. 
Here's the reasoning:
1. **Asexual Reproduction**: This type of reproduction involves a single organism reproducing without the need for genetic material from another organism, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent. While this can be advantageous in stable environments, it does not increase genetic diversity, which is crucial during environmental stress.
2. **Sexual Reproduction**: In contrast, sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two parents, creating genetic variation among offspring. This variation can be beneficial in stressful or changing environments, as it may increase the likelihood of some offspring surviving and adapting to the new conditions.
3. **Hysterical and Internal Reproduction**: The term "hysterical reproduction" is not a scientifically recognized type of reproduction. "Internal reproduction" could refer to the internal fertilization process, but it doesn't specifically address the environmental stress aspect.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
- **A. sexual reproduction**

A: Let's think step by step.
Ranchers' primary concern with the return of wolves often centers around the impact on their livestock. Wolves are predators, and their presence can lead to increased incidents of livestock, such as sheep and cattle, being attacked and killed. This can cause significant financial loss for ranchers. Therefore, the fear of livestock predation is the most direct and pressing concern for them. The other options, such as vegetation predation or human predation, are not typically associated with the behavior of wolves. Loss of environment is also not a direct consequence of wolves returning but rather a broader ecological issue. 
Therefore, the most logical answer is: 
A. livestock predation.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. livestock predation.

The cell wall contains not only cellulose and protein, but other polysaccharides as well. In fact, two other classes of polysaccharides, hemicelluloses and pectic polysaccharides, can comprise 30% of the dry mass of the cell wall. The cell wall provides structural support and protection. Pores in the cell wall allow water and nutrients to move into and out of the cell. The cell wall also prevents the plant cell from bursting when water enters the cell.             question:             What is the rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell?             options:             ['A. cell barrier', 'B. cell wall', 'C. cell root', 'D. cell shield']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking for the name of the rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell. To find the correct answer, we need to refer to the information provided in the passage.
1. The passage states: "A cell wall is a rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell.”
2. From the passage, we know that the term "cell wall" is explicitly mentioned as the rigid layer located outside the cell membrane that surrounds the cell.
3. Now, let's evaluate the options provided:
   - Option A: 'cell barrier' - This term is not mentioned in the passage.
   - Option B: 'cell wall' - This matches exactly with the term from the passage.
   - Option C: 'cell root' - This is not used in the context of cell structure in the passage.
   - Option D: 'cell shield' - This term is also not mentioned in the passage.
Based on the passage, Option B: ‘cell wall’ is the correct answer because it correctly matches the description given.
Thus, the rigid layer that is found outside the cell membrane and surrounds the cell is the 'cell wall'. The correct answer is 'B. cell wall'.

Q: support:             Intrapleural pressure is the pressure of the air within the pleural cavity, between the visceral and parietal pleurae. Similar to intra-alveolar pressure, intrapleural pressure also changes during the different phases of breathing. However, due to certain characteristics of the lungs, the intrapleural pressure is always lower than, or negative to, the intra-alveolar pressure (and therefore also to atmospheric pressure). Although it fluctuates during inspiration and expiration, intrapleural pressure remains approximately –4 mm Hg throughout the breathing cycle. Competing forces within the thorax cause the formation of the negative intrapleural pressure. One of these forces relates to the elasticity of the lungs themselves—elastic tissue pulls the lungs inward, away from the thoracic wall. Surface tension of alveolar fluid, which is mostly water, also creates an inward pull of the lung tissue. This inward tension from the lungs is countered by opposing forces from the pleural fluid and thoracic wall. Surface tension within the pleural cavity pulls the lungs outward. Too much or too little pleural fluid would hinder the creation of the negative intrapleural pressure; therefore, the level must be closely monitored by the mesothelial cells and drained by the lymphatic system. Since the parietal pleura is attached to the thoracic wall, the natural elasticity of the chest wall opposes the inward pull of the lungs. Ultimately, the outward pull is slightly greater than the inward pull, creating the –4 mm Hg intrapleural pressure relative to the intraalveolar pressure. Transpulmonary pressure is the difference between the intrapleural and intra-alveolar pressures, and it determines the size of the lungs. A higher transpulmonary pressure corresponds to a larger lung.             question:             Surface tension of alveolar fluid, which is mostly water, creates an inward pull of the tissue of what organ?             options:             ['A. brain', 'B. spleen', 'C. lung', 'D. heart']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to understand the context provided about intrapleural pressure and the role of surface tension of alveolar fluid. The alveolar fluid is mentioned in connection with its effect on a specific organ's tissues. 
1. The passage discusses the mechanics of breathing and mentions how the alveolar fluid, mainly composed of water, affects the pressure dynamics within the thorax.
2. The surface tension of this fluid creates an inward pull on the tissue of an organ.
3. Given the context, the organ in question is part of the respiratory system, where the alveoli are located.
4. The alveoli are small air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs.
Therefore, surface tension of the alveolar fluid creates an inward pull on the tissue of the "C. lung."

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'C. lung'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to analyze the options given and understand the characteristics associated with each type of tumor. Here are the step-by-step thoughts:
1. **Understanding Tumor Types:**
   - **Benign Tumors:** These are non-cancerous tumors that grow slowly and do not spread to other parts of the body. They are often encapsulated, making them easy to remove completely via surgery. Benign tumors generally do not cause serious problems unless they press on vital structures or secrete hormones.
   - **Toxic Tumors:** This term is not standard in medical terminology to describe a type of tumor. It might refer to a tumor causing toxicity due to hormone secretion or other factors, but it is not a recognized classification like benign or malignant.
   - **Persistent Tumors:** This term usually refers to a tumor that does not easily go away. It might be used to describe the behavior of a tumor but isn’t a specific category like benign or malignant.
   - **Malignant Tumors:** These are cancerous and tend to grow rapidly, invade surrounding tissue, and can metastasize to distant body parts. They are considered serious and more challenging to treat completely with surgery alone.
2. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - The

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'A. benign' because benign tumors are typically non-cancerous, do not spread, and can often be completely removed by surgery without causing serious problems.

Skin', 'B. skeleton', 'C. Muscle', 'D. skull']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer to the question "What supports and protects the soft organs of the body?", we should consider the information provided in the passage:
1. The passage states that "The skeleton supports and protects the soft organs of the body."
2. The passage provides examples, such as the skull surrounding the brain and the rib cage protecting the heart and lungs, which are parts of the skeleton.
Given the information above, the skeleton plays a critical role in supporting and protecting the body's soft organs.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: Skin – While the skin has protective functions, it is not primarily responsible for supporting and protecting soft organs in the same way the skeleton is.
- Option B: Skeleton – This option directly matches the information given in the passage.
- Option C: Muscle – Muscles facilitate movement and posture but do not primarily serve to protect and support soft organs in the context provided.
- Option D: Skull – The skull is part of the skeleton and specifically protects the brain, but it's not inclusive of the entire skeleton's role in protecting other organs.
Thus, the correct answer is Option B: skeleton.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. skeleton.

Q: support:             How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of electrons in the outer energy level of their atoms. Metalloids have from three to six electrons in their outer energy level. Boron, pictured in the Figure below , is the only metalloid with just three electrons in its outer energy level. It tends to act like metals by giving up its electrons in chemical reactions. Metalloids with more than four electrons in their outer energy level (arsenic, antimony, and tellurium) tend to act like nonmetals by gaining electrons in chemical reactions. Those with exactly four electrons in their outer energy level (silicon and germanium) may act like either metals or nonmetals, depending on the other elements in the reaction.             question:             How metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements depends mainly on the number of what, in the outer energy level of their atoms?             options:             ['A. neutrons', 'B. positrons', 'C. protons', 'D. electrons']
A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to identify what the question is asking about. The question asks how metalloids behave in chemical interactions with other elements and what this behavior depends on, specifically related to the outer energy level of their atoms.
Next, let's break down the supporting text provided:

A: Let's think step by step.
To understand how water moves from the roots to the leaves, it's important to focus on how plants are structured and how water transport occurs within this structure.
1. **Roots Absorb Water**: The process begins with the roots of the plant, which absorb water from the soil. Root hairs increase the surface area for absorption.
2. **Xylem Vessels**: The water absorbed by the roots is then transported through specialized structures known as xylem vessels. These are tube-like structures made up of water-conducting cells. They form a continuous network throughout the plant, from the roots up through the stem and into the leaves.
3. **Transpiration Pull**: Transpiration, which is the process of water evaporation from the surfaces of leaves, creates a negative pressure (also known as tension) within the xylem vessels. This tension helps to "pull" water upward from the roots through the xylem.
4. **Capillary Action and Cohesion-Tension**: Water molecules are cohesive; they tend to stick together through hydrogen bonding. This property, along with the thin diameter of xylem vessels, aids in capillary action where water moves up small tubes against gravity.
5. **Delivery to Leaves**: Eventually,

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. water-conducting cells.' The xylem vessels, which are made up of water-conducting cells, are responsible for transporting water from the

Motors have loops of wire in a magnetic field. When current is passed through the loops, the magnetic field exerts torque on the loops, which rotates a shaft. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical work in the process. (See Figure 22.34.             question:             Motors are the most common application of magnetic force on current-carrying wires. motors have loops of wire in this?             options:             ['A. magnetic field', 'B. capacitors', 'C. spark plugs', 'D. electrical circuit']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to identify what the loops of wire in motors are situated in. The context provided explains how motors operate by using magnetic forces on current-carrying wires. It specifically mentions that when current passes through the loops of wire, the magnetic field exerts torque on these loops, causing them to rotate. This clearly indicates that the loops of wire are placed in a magnetic field.
Now let's evaluate the options given:
- A. magnetic field: This is consistent with the description provided, where the loops of wire are in a magnetic field, enabling torque to be exerted on them.
- B. capacitors: While capacitors are components that store electrical energy, they are not described as the environment in which the loops operate to generate torque.
- C. spark plugs: Spark plugs are components used in engines to ignite the fuel-air mixture, not parts of the motor's wire loops arrangement.
- D. electrical circuit: While the loops of wire are part of an electrical circuit, the context given specifically highlights the magnetic field as the setting in which torque is exerted.
Therefore, the correct answer is A. magnetic field.

The boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings. For liquids in open containers, this pressure is that due to the earth’s atmosphere. The normal boiling point of a liquid is defined as its boiling point when surrounding pressure is equal to 1 atm (101.3 kPa). Figure 10.24 shows the variation in vapor pressure with temperature for several different.             question:             What term is used to describe when a liquid is the temperature at which its equilibrium vapor pressure is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by its gaseous surroundings?             options:             ['A. burning point', 'B. freezing point', 'C. evaporating point', 'D. boiling point']
A: Let's think step by step.
To identify the correct term, let's first understand the definition provided:
- The term describes the temperature at which a liquid's equilibrium vapor pressure equals the pressure exerted on it by its gaseous surroundings.
The term that fits this definition is the "boiling point." It is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure, causing the liquid to start converting into gas.
Let's review the options:
- A. Burning point: This is related to combustion and is not relevant to vapor pressure equilibrium.
- B. Freezing point: This is the temperature at which a liquid becomes a solid; it is not related to vapor pressure equilibrium with its gaseous surroundings.
- C. Evaporating point: While related to the change of state from liquid to gas, this is not the specific term used to describe the condition where the vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure.
- D. Boiling point: This is the correct term as per the explanation.
Therefore, the term used is "D. boiling point."

Q: support:             Basic to Bohr’s model is the idea of energy levels. Energy levels are areas located at fixed distances from the nucleus of the atom. They are the only places where electrons can be found. Energy levels are a little like rungs on a ladder. You can stand on one rung or another but not between the rungs. The same goes for electrons. They can occupy one energy level or another but not the space between energy levels.             question:             What are the areas located at fixed distances from the nucleus of the atom?             options:             ['A. atomic regions', 'B. energy levels', 'C. molar levels', 'D. orbit points']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information given in the support text. The text states that "Basic to Bohr’s model is the idea of energy levels," and that "Energy levels are areas located at fixed distances from the nucleus of the atom." 
Therefore, according to the text, energy levels are synonymous with the areas located at fixed distances from the nucleus. Now, let's match this information with the options provided:
- 'A. atomic regions': This term is not mentioned in the text as a synonym for the fixed distance areas.
- 'B. energy levels': This matches exactly with what the text states about areas at fixed distances.
- 'C. molar levels': This term is not mentioned in the text, and it doesn't relate to the concept described.
- 'D. orbit points': The text does not equate fixed distance areas with orbit points.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is 'B. energy levels'.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. energy levels'.

Q: support:             A liquid is a state of matter in which particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container. However, the particles cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container.             question:             In which state of matter do particles take the shape of their container, but cannot expand to fill it?             options:             ['A. chemical', 'B. liquid', 'C. gas', 'D. mixture']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, let's analyze the properties of different states of matter:
1. **Solid**: In this state, particles are tightly packed in a fixed arrangement. Solids have a definite shape and volume. Particles do not move around but can vibrate in place. Solids do not take the shape of their container.
2. **Liquid**: In a liquid state, particles are close together but can move past one another, allowing the liquid to flow. Liquids take the shape of their container but do not expand to fill the container; they have a definite volume but no definite shape.
3. **Gas**: Gas particles are far apart and move freely. Gases take both the shape and the volume of their container, expanding to fill the entire space available.
4. **Plasma**: Not mentioned in the options, but includes ionized gas with similar properties to gas in terms of taking shape and volume of the container.
Now, let's examine the options given in the question:
- **A. Chemical**: This is not a state of matter. "Chemical" refers to substances or the interactions between substances.
- **B. Liquid**: Matches the criteria of taking the shape of their container but not expanding to fill it.
- **

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is **B. liquid**. This is the state of matter where particles take the shape of their container but cannot expand to fill it.

Q: support:             Runoff is likely to cause more erosion if the land is bare. Plants help hold the soil in place. The runoff water in Figure below is brown because it eroded soil from a bare, sloping field. Can you find evidence of erosion by runoff where you live? What should you look for?.             question:             Runoff is likely to cause more what if the land is bare?             options:             ['A. sediment', 'B. erosion', 'C. weathering', 'D. abrasion']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what runoff is likely to cause more of if the land is bare, let's analyze the given information. The key detail mentioned is that plants help hold the soil in place. If the land is bare, without plants, the soil can easily be washed away by runoff. This means that the absence of plants makes the soil more susceptible to being carried away by water, which is referred to as erosion. 
The question is asking what increases when runoff occurs on bare land. Since plants prevent soil erosion, bare land without them will likely experience more erosion due to the runoff. Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. erosion

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. erosion'.

Q: support:             Colon The cecum blends seamlessly with the colon. Upon entering the colon, the food residue first travels up the ascending colon on the right side of the abdomen. At the inferior surface of the liver, the colon bends to form the right colic flexure (hepatic flexure) and becomes the transverse colon. The region defined as hindgut begins with the last third of the transverse colon and continues on. Food residue passing through the transverse colon travels across to the left side of the abdomen, where the colon angles sharply immediately inferior to the spleen, at the left colic flexure (splenic flexure). From there, food residue passes through the descending colon, which runs down the left side of the posterior abdominal wall. After entering the pelvis inferiorly, it becomes the s-shaped sigmoid colon, which extends medially to the midline (Figure 23.21). The ascending and descending colon, and the rectum (discussed next) are located in the retroperitoneum. The transverse and sigmoid colon are tethered to the posterior abdominal wall by the mesocolon.             question:             What organ is subdivided into ascending, descending, transverse and sigmoid parts?             options:             ['A. uterus', 'B. lungs', 'C. heart', 'D. colon']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which organ is subdivided into the ascending, descending, transverse, and sigmoid parts, we need to focus on each option and relate them to the passage provided.
1. **A. Uterus:** The uterus is not divided into these specific parts. It is rather subdivided into parts like the fundus, body, and cervix.
2. **B. Lungs:** The lungs are not categorized into ascending, descending, transverse, or sigmoid parts. They are typically divided into lobes.
3. **C. Heart:** The heart is not divided into ascending, descending, transverse, or sigmoid parts. It has parts like atria, ventricles, and valves.
4. **D. Colon:** In the passage, it's clearly stated that the colon is the organ that is subdivided into ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon.
Thus, the correct answer is the colon. The organ that is subdivided into ascending, descending, transverse, and sigmoid parts is the colon.
Therefore, the correct option is:
**D. colon**

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. colon'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the type of waste that ammonia, urea, and uric acid are, let's consider the following:
1. **Ammonia**: This is a compound that contains nitrogen. It is known to be a waste product of protein metabolism in many organisms.
2. **Urea**: Urea is another nitrogen-containing compound. It is the primary end product of nitrogen metabolism in mammals and is excreted in urine.
3. **Uric Acid**: This is also a nitrogenous compound produced by the breakdown of purines in many organisms.
Since all these compounds—ammonia, urea, and uric acid—contain nitrogen and are products of nitrogen metabolism or excretion, they are classified as nitrogenous waste. 
Thus, the correct answer is:
'A. nitrogenous'

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'A. nitrogenous'

Q: support:             Some of the best known types of fungi are mushrooms, which can be edible or poisonous ( Figure below ). Many species are grown commercially, but others are harvested from the wild. When you order a pizza with mushrooms or add them to your salad, you are most likely eating Agaricus bisporus , known as white or button mushrooms, the most commonly eaten species. Other mushroom species are gathered from the wild for people to eat or for commercial sale. Many mushroom species are poisonous to humans. Some mushrooms will simply give you a stomachache, while others may kill you. Some mushrooms you can eat when they are cooked but are poisonous when raw. So if you find mushrooms in the wild, don't eat them until you are certain they are safe!.             question:             Mushrooms are an example of what type of organism, which includes beneficial and toxic specimens?             options:             ['A. seeds', 'B. spores', 'C. bacteria', 'D. fungi']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information given and the options provided.
1. **Understanding the Question:** The question asks us to identify the type of organism that includes both beneficial and toxic specimens, specifically referring to mushrooms.
2. **Given Information:** 
   - The passage mentions that mushrooms are a well-known type of fungi.
   - It explains that mushrooms can be edible or poisonous.
   - It also indicates that mushrooms belong to the category of fungi, which can be grown commercially or harvested from the wild.
3. **Options Analysis:**
   - **A. Seeds:** Seeds are the reproductive units of plants. While some plants with seeds may have poisonous parts, seeds themselves are not the category that includes mushrooms.
   - **B. Spores:** Spores are a reproductive unit used by fungi, but spores are not a category of organisms. Instead, they are a part of fungi.
   - **C. Bacteria:** Bacteria are a completely different category of microorganisms and do not include mushrooms.
   - **D. Fungi:** Fungi is the kingdom that mushrooms belong to and includes both beneficial and toxic specimens. 
4. **Conclusion:** Based on the explanation provided in the passage and the options available, mushrooms are a type of fungi

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to focus on what is being compared to provide clues to evolution and development. The question mentions "Comparing what sequences" and provides four options: genes, DNA, genome, and organisms. 
- Option A, "genes," refers to specific segments of DNA that code for proteins or have regulatory functions. While comparing genes can provide some insight into evolution and development, it is not the most comprehensive choice given the context.
- Option B, "DNA," refers to the molecule that carries genetic information. Comparing DNA sequences can indeed provide information about evolution and development, as it includes genes, regulatory elements, and non-coding regions. However, it is not as specific as the term "genome."
- Option C, "genome," represents the complete set of an organism's DNA, including all of its genes. Comparing genome sequences offers a comprehensive view of evolutionary relationships and developmental processes, making it the most relevant choice here.
- Option D, "organisms," doesn't speak to sequences specifically. While comparing organisms (their phenotypes or physical traits) can give some evolutionary insights, it is not directly related to sequence comparison.
Therefore, the best answer is C. genome, as it fully encompasses the sequences being compared to provide clues to

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is option C. genome.

Q: support:             There are other units in chemistry that are important, and we will cover others in the course of the entire book. One of the fundamental quantities in science is temperature. Temperature is a measure of the average amount of energy of motion, or kinetic energy, a system contains. Temperatures are expressed using scales that use units called degrees, and there are several temperature scales in use. In the United States, the commonly used temperature scale is the Fahrenheit scale (symbolized by °F and spoken as “degrees Fahrenheit”). On this scale, the freezing point of liquid water (the temperature at which liquid water turns to solid ice) is 32°F, and the boiling point of water (the temperature at which liquid water turns to steam) is 212°F. Science also uses other scales to express temperature. The Celsius scale (symbolized by °C and spoken as “degrees Celsius”) is a temperature scale where 0°C is the freezing point of water and 100°C is the boiling point of water; the scale is divided into 100 divisions between these two landmarks and extended higher and lower. By comparing the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, a conversion between the two scales can be determined: °C=(°F–32) × 59° Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.             question:             What is a measure of the average amount of energy of motion, or kinetic energy, a system contains called?             options:             ['A. size', 'B. variation', 'C. precipitation', 'D. temperature']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is correct, let's review the information given:
The text states that "temperature is a measure of the average amount of energy of motion, or kinetic energy, a system contains." 
Now, let's evaluate the options provided:
- A. size: This is not related to energy or motion.
- B. variation: Although variation can relate to changes, it is not specifically related to energy or motion in this context.
- C. precipitation: This is related to weather conditions and not to measuring energy or motion.
- D. temperature: The text explicitly defines temperature as the measure of the average kinetic energy of a system.
Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is:
D. temperature

Q: support:             U92235 + n01® B56141a + K3692r + 3n01 This hypothesis was confirmed by detecting the krypton-92 fission product. As discussed in Section 20.2 "Nuclear Reactions", the nucleus usually divides asymmetrically rather than into two equal parts, and the fission of a given nuclide does not give the same products every time. In a typical nuclear fission reaction, more than one neutron is released by each dividing nucleus. When these neutrons collide with and induce fission in other neighboring nuclei, a self-sustaining series of nuclear fission reactions known as anuclear chain reaction can result (Figure 20.16 "The Curve of Nuclear Binding Energy"). For example, the fission of 235U releases two to three neutrons per fission event. If absorbed by other 235U nuclei, those neutrons induce additional fission events, and the rate of the fission reaction increases geometrically. Each series of events is called a generation. Experimentally, it is found that some minimum mass of a fissile isotope is required to sustain a nuclear chain reaction; if the mass is too low, too many neutrons are able to escape without being captured and inducing a fission reaction. The minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission is called the critical mass. This amount depends on the purity of the material and the shape of the mass, which corresponds to the amount of surface area available from which neutrons can escape, and on the identity of the isotope. If the mass of the fissile isotope is greater than the critical mass, then under the right conditions, the resulting supercritical mass can release energy explosively. The enormous energy released from nuclear chain reactions is responsible for the massive destruction caused by the detonation of nuclear weapons such as fission bombs, but it also forms the basis of the nuclear power industry. Nuclear fusion, in which two light nuclei combine to produce a heavier, more stable nucleus, is the opposite of nuclear fission. As in the nuclear transmutation reactions discussed in Section 20.2 "Nuclear.             question:             What is the minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission called?             options:             ['A. baseline mass', 'B. critical mass', 'C. particular mass', 'D. concentrated mass']
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the answer to the question, let's break down the relevant part of the provided text:
1. The text discusses a nuclear chain reaction, which involves the fission of a fissile isotope like Uranium-235 (U-235).
2. For a nuclear chain reaction to be sustained, there needs to be a certain amount of the fissile material.
3. If the mass is too low, many neutrons escape without causing further fission, and the reaction cannot be sustained.
4. The text states, "The minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission is called the critical mass."
5. This directly answers the question about what the minimum mass for sustained fission is called.
With this understanding from the passage, we can determine the correct answer:
The minimum mass capable of supporting sustained fission is called the "critical mass."
Therefore, the correct option is:
B. critical mass

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. critical mass'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the cell cycle does, we need to think about the various stages and outcomes of the cell cycle in eukaryotic cells.
1. **The Purpose of the Cell Cycle**: The cell cycle is the series of events that a eukaryotic cell goes through to grow and divide. Its main purpose is to ensure that cells divide in a controlled manner to produce new cells for growth, repair, and reproduction.
2. **Stages of the Cell Cycle**: This cycle includes stages such as growth (G1 and G2 phases), DNA replication (S phase), and cell division (mitosis and cytokinesis in the M phase).
3. **Outcomes of the Cell Cycle**: The end result of the cycle is cell division, which leads to the reproduction of a cell. This means that each cycle results in two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the original cell.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A: only reproduce cells** – This implies that cells are only made anew, but it doesn't encompass the full process of dividing existing cells, which is also an important part of the cell cycle.
- **Option B: create new cells** – While this is partially true, creating new cells is achieved through the division process,

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. divide and reproduce cells'.

A third bony plate, also part of the ethmoid bone, is the superior nasal concha. It is much smaller and out of sight, above the middle concha. The superior nasal concha is located just lateral to the perpendicular plate, in the upper nasal cavity.             question:             Inside the nasal area of the skull, the nasal cavity is divided into halves by the what?             options:             ['A. cerebral cortex', 'B. nasal septum', 'C. cell wall', 'D. cytoplasm']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided:
1. The question asks about the structure that divides the nasal cavity into halves.
2. The passage states: "Inside the nasal area of the skull, the nasal cavity is divided into halves by the nasal septum."

These bacteria are important because they help cycle nitrogen through the environment for other living things to use. Nitrogen cannot be made by living organisms, so it must be continually recycled. Organisms need nitrogen to make organic compounds, such as DNA.             question:             Bacteria can be chemotrophs, which obtain what by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment?             options:             ['A. waste', 'B. chemials', 'C. food', 'D. energy']
A: Let's think step by step.
We need to determine what chemotrophs, specifically bacteria, obtain by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment.
1. The support passage mentions that "Chemosynthetic bacteria, or chemotrophs, obtain energy by breaking down chemical compounds in their environment."
2. The statement directly answers the question: chemotrophs obtain energy from this process.
Let's match this understanding with the given options:
- 'A. waste': This does not align with the explanation, as the passage does not mention chemotrophs obtaining waste.
- 'B. chemicals': This suggests obtaining chemicals, but they actually utilize chemicals to obtain something else.
- 'C. food': The passage does not mention food as the obtained result of chemosynthesis.
- 'D. energy': This aligns perfectly with the passage, as chemotrophs obtain energy.
Thus, the correct answer is 'D. energy'.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. energy'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we can question how each of the given options relates to the threats listed: habitat loss, introduced species, overharvesting, and global change.
- **Option A: biodiversity**
  - Habitat loss directly affects biodiversity as it leads to the displacement or extinction of species.
  - Introduced species can threaten native species, impacting overall biodiversity.
  - Overharvesting of resources can deplete species, reducing biodiversity.
  - Global change, including climate change, can alter ecosystems, threatening species survival and thus biodiversity.
- **Option B: transportation**
  - Habitat loss, introduced species, overharvesting, and global change do not directly threaten transportation.
- **Option C: the earth's gravity**
  - These threats do not have any direct impact on the earth's gravity.
- **Option D: the sun**
  - These threats do not affect the sun in any known way.
Based on this, the threats of habitat loss, introduced species, overharvesting, and global change are major threats to **biodiversity**.
Thus, the correct answer is:
- **A. biodiversity**

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. biodiversity

A: Let's think step by step.
To understand which structures inside the veins maintain a unidirectional flow of blood despite the low blood pressure, we need to consider the anatomy of veins and how they function:
1. **Veins**: Veins are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. Unlike arteries, which carry blood away from the heart under high pressure, veins experience much lower blood pressure.
2. **Low Blood Pressure in Veins**: This low pressure results from the blood having traveled a considerable distance from the heart and through various capillary networks, which reduce its force.
3. **Importance of Unidirectional Blood Flow**: For the circulatory system to function effectively, blood must move in one direction, back toward the heart, preventing any backflow.
4. **Valves in Veins**: Most veins, especially those in the limbs, contain structures known as **valves**. These are flap-like structures made of endothelial tissue that open to allow blood to flow toward the heart and close if the blood begins to move backward. 
5. **How Valves Work**: When blood flows correctly, the valves open. If the blood tries to flow backward (due to gravity or any other reason), the valves close, preventing this backward flow and ensuring the unidirectional

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'A. valves'

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's break down the question:
1. **Key Concepts Identification**: The question asks for the name of the process by which pollen is transferred from an anther (part of the male reproductive organ) to a stigma (part of the female reproductive organ) in angiosperms (flowering plants).
2. **Understanding the Options**:
   - **A. Pollination**: This is the biological process where pollen is transferred from the male part (anther) to the female part (stigma) of a flower, enabling fertilization.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which molecule is present in large quantities within an erythrocyte (red blood cell), we need to examine the primary function and characteristics of erythrocytes.
1. **Function of Erythrocytes**: Erythrocytes, or red blood cells, are primarily responsible for the transport of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. 
2. **Key Component for Oxygen Transport**: The molecule responsible for binding and carrying oxygen in erythrocytes is hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein that can bind oxygen and is crucial for the red blood cell's function.
3. **Quantity of Molecules**: Given the erythrocyte's primary role in oxygen transport, it must contain a significant amount of hemoglobin to effectively perform its function. In fact, each erythrocyte is densely packed with hemoglobin, approximately 250 million molecules per cell, to efficiently carry as much oxygen as possible.
Knowing that hemoglobin is essential for the oxygen-carrying ability of red blood cells and is present in high quantities, we can determine that the correct answer is:
B. hemoglobin

Q: support:             The Major Divisions of Land Plants Land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of vascular tissue, as detailed in Figure 14.8. Plants that lack vascular tissue formed of specialized cells for the transport of water and nutrients are referred to as nonvascular plants. The bryophytes, liverworts, mosses, and hornworts are seedless and nonvascular, and likely appeared early in land plant evolution. Vascular plants developed a network of cells that conduct water and solutes through the plant body. The first vascular plants appeared in the late Ordovician (461–444 million years ago) and were probably similar to lycophytes, which include club mosses (not to be confused with the mosses) and the pterophytes (ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns). Lycophytes and pterophytes are referred to as seedless vascular plants. They do not produce seeds, which are embryos with their stored food reserves protected by a hard casing. The seed plants form the largest group of all existing plants and, hence, dominate the landscape. Seed plants include gymnosperms, most notably conifers, which produce “naked.             question:             Land plants are classified into two major groups according to the absence or presence of what tissue?             options:             ['A. root', 'B. disease', 'C. vascular', 'D. bacterial']

Q: support:             Salts Recall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more electrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes negatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions other than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next. A typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water molecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions, pulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart into molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an electrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and prompting muscle contraction.             question:             What substances, which are distinct from acids and bases, form when ions form ionic bonds?             options:             ['A. salts', 'B. oils', 'C. water molecules', 'D. vitamins']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, let's analyze the information provided:
1. **Definition of Salts**: The text explains that salts are formed when ions create ionic bonds. This process involves an atom giving up electrons to become positively charged and another atom accepting electrons to become negatively charged. 
2. **Characteristic of Salts**: Salts, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions that are neither H+ nor OH–. This characteristic differentiates them from acids and bases.
3. **Example of a Salt**: Sodium chloride (NaCl) is given as a typical example of a salt that dissociates in water, dividing into positive sodium ions (Na+) and negative chloride ions (Cl-).
4. **Function of Dissociated Ions**: These ions in solution are electrolytes and can conduct electricity, which is essential for processes like transmitting nerve impulses and muscle contraction.
Based on this breakdown:
- **A. Salts**: As described, salts are substances formed by ionic bonds and they dissociate into non-H+ and non-OH– ions in water.
- **B. Oils, C. Water molecules, D. Vitamins**: These substances are not described in the passage as being formed by ionic bonds or as dissociating in water

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct apparatus used for carrying out an electrolysis reaction, let's analyze the provided information:
1. **Understanding Electrolysis Reaction**: An electrolysis reaction involves a nonspontaneous chemical process that is driven by an external source of electrical energy.
2. **Electrolytic Cell**: According to the support information, an electrolytic cell is specifically mentioned as the apparatus used for carrying out such an electrolysis reaction. It is defined as an apparatus where electric current is applied to provide a source of electrons for driving the nonspontaneous reaction.
3. **Voltaic Cell**: The text contrasts an electrolytic cell with a voltaic cell. Unlike an electrolytic cell, a voltaic cell is used for spontaneous reactions that release electrons.
4. **Options Exploration**:
   - **A. catalyst**: A catalyst accelerates a reaction but is not the apparatus; it does not fit the description of an apparatus used to apply electric current.
   - **B. an electrolytic cell**: Matches the exact description from the passage as the apparatus used for an electrolysis reaction.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when light is refracted or scattered, we need to understand the conditions for these phenomena:
1. **Refraction** occurs when light passes from one medium into another medium with a different density, causing the light to change direction. This is commonly seen when light enters water, air, or glass from another medium.
2. **Scattering** happens when light interacts with small particles or irregularities in a medium, causing the light to deviate in different directions. Scattering occurs in the atmosphere when sunlight interacts with air molecules, causing the sky to appear blue.
Given the support statement that transmitted light may be refracted or scattered, the correct answer to the question "What two ways may light be transmitted?" would focus on these processes.
- Option A: "refracted or scattered" accurately describes both processes involved with transmitted light according to the initial statement.
- Options B, C, and D involve processes like absorption, magnification, or reflection, which are not relevant to the question about transmitted light.
Therefore, the correct choice is **Option A: refracted or scattered**.

They are triggered by changes in the environment, such as the days growing shorter in the fall.             question:             Triggered by changes in the environment, migration and hibernation occur as cycles on what temporal basis?             options:             ['A. annual', 'B. seasonally', 'C. bi-annually', 'D. monthly']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information given in the question and support statement.
1. The support statement mentions that examples of behaviors with annual cycles include migration and hibernation. This indicates that these behaviors are described as having an "annual cycle."
2. The question asks what temporal basis these behaviors occur on, when they are triggered by environmental changes.
3. From the options provided:
   - A. Annual: Occurs once every year, aligning with the "annual cycle" mentioned in the support.
   - B. Seasonally: Occurs once every season, which can also imply multiple times a year.
   - C. Bi-annually: Occurs twice a year.
   - D. Monthly: Occurs every month.
4. The support text specifies that migration and hibernation are annual cycles, meaning they occur once a year, typically triggered by seasonal environmental changes like the shortening of days in fall.
5. Therefore, the best choice that aligns with the "annual cycles" described in the support statement is:
Answer: A. annual

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. annual

Q: support:             Extending from the upper corners of the uterus are the two fallopian tubes. Each tube reaches (but is not attached to) one of the ovaries. The ovary end of the tube has a fringelike structure that moves in waves. The motion sweeps eggs from the ovary into the tube.             question:             What pair of tubes that extends toward the ovaries features a fringelike structure that sweeps eggs inside?             options:             ['A. golgi apparatus', 'B. fallopian tubes', 'C. vas deferens', 'D. ovarian tubes']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question and the given options.
1. **Understanding the question**: We're asked to identify a pair of tubes that extend toward the ovaries and feature a fringelike structure that sweeps eggs inside.
2. **Recall the anatomy**: From the support text provided, it mentions that extending from the upper corners of the uterus are the two fallopian tubes, which reach toward the ovaries. The text highlights that these tubes have fringelike structures that help in sweeping the eggs from the ovary into the tube.
3. **Evaluate the options**:
   - **A. Golgi apparatus**: This is not relevant to reproductive anatomy; it is an organelle involved in cell processes.
   - **B. Fallopian tubes**: The support text specifically identifies fallopian tubes as extending from the uterus towards the ovaries and having fringelike structures that assist in moving eggs.
   - **C. Vas deferens**: This pertains to the male reproductive system, not involved with the ovaries.
   - **D. Ovarian tubes**: This term is not commonly used in human anatomy to describe the structures in question; fallopian tubes is the universally accepted term.
From the above analysis, the correct answer is

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. fallopian tubes

Q: support:                          question:             In most animals, what sense is related to balance or equilibrium?             options:             ['A. feeling', 'B. vision', 'C. hearing', 'D. tasting']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which sense is related to balance or equilibrium in most animals, we should consider the following points:
1. **Sense Functions:**
   - **Feeling (Touch):** Primarily involves detecting pressure, temperature, and pain. It doesn't typically relate to balance or equilibrium.
   - **Vision:** While vision can help with spatial orientation and can assist in maintaining balance, it is not the primary sense responsible for equilibrium.
   - **Hearing:** Inside the inner ear of many animals (including humans) is the vestibular system, which is crucial for balance. It includes structures like the semicircular canals and otolith organs that detect head movements and gravitational pull, helping maintain equilibrium.
   - **Tasting:** Involves detecting flavors with taste buds and is unrelated to balance.
2. **Conclusion:**
   The sense most directly related to balance or equilibrium in animals is located in the inner ear, which is part of the auditory (hearing) system.
Therefore, the correct option is:
C. hearing

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. hearing

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to identify what forms as a result of the fusion of spores from two parents during sexual reproduction.
The support sentence provided states: "Sexual reproduction occurs when spores from two parents fuse and form a zygospore." This clearly indicates that the fusion of spores from two parents results in the formation of a "zygospore."
Next, let's evaluate the options provided:
- A. monospore: There is no indication that a monospore is formed during the fusion of two spores.
- B. spirogyra: Spirogyra is a type of green algae, not something formed from the fusion of two spores.
- C. zygospore: The support directly states that a zygospore is formed from the fusion of spores from two parents.
- D. xerophyte: A xerophyte is a type of plant adapted to dry environments, not related to spore fusion.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. zygospore

Q: support:             Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege. org/l/sex_selection) for informative videos on sexual selection. In monogamous systems, one male and one female are paired for at least one breeding season. In some animals, such as the gray wolf, these associations can last much longer, even a lifetime. Several explanations have been proposed for this type of.             question:             In a monogamous pairing, a male individual is generally paired with what other type of individual in a sexual relationship?             options:             ['A. drone', 'B. female', 'C. worker', 'D. male']
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the answer, we need to understand the concept of monogamous pairing in the context of sexual relationships in animals. 
1. The question is asking about what type of individual a male is typically paired with in a monogamous pairing.
2. Monogamous systems are characterized by one male and one female pairing for the purpose of reproduction, at least for one breeding season.
3. This is based on the biological concept that in many species, monogamous pairings involve a male-female relationship to reproduce successfully.
Given these considerations, let's evaluate the options:
- 'A. drone': Generally refers to a male bee, not relevant here.
- 'B. female': This aligns with the understanding of monogamous biological pairings.
- 'C. worker': Usually refers to non-reproductive roles in some species, not related to this context.
- 'D. male': Typically refers to a male-male pairing which is not common in the context of monogamy aimed at reproduction.
Thus, the correct answer is 'B. female', as a male in a monogamous pairing is generally paired with a female for reproductive purposes.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. female'.

Q: support:             Although the masses of the electron, the proton, and the neutron are known to a high degree of precision (Table 1.3 "Properties of Subatomic Particles*"), the mass of any given atom is not simply the sum of the masses of its electrons, protons, and neutrons. For example, the ratio of the masses of 1H (hydrogen) and 2H (deuterium) is actually 0.500384, rather than 0.49979 as predicted from the numbers of neutrons and protons present. Although the difference in mass is small, it is extremely important because it is the source of the huge amounts of energy released in nuclear reactions (Chapter 20 "Nuclear Chemistry"). Because atoms are much too small to measure individually and do not have a charge, there is no convenient way to accurately measure absolute atomic masses. Scientists can measure relative atomic masses very accurately, however, using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. The technique is conceptually similar to the one Thomson used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of the electron. First, electrons are removed from or added to atoms or molecules, thus producing charged particles called ions. When an electric field is applied, the ions are accelerated into a separate chamber where they are deflected from their initial trajectory by a magnetic field, like the electrons in Thomson’s experiment. The extent of the deflection depends on the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. By measuring the relative deflection of ions that have the same charge, scientists can determine their relative masses (Figure 1.25 "Determining Relative Atomic Masses Using a Mass Spectrometer"). Thus it is not possible to calculate absolute atomic masses accurately by simply adding together the masses of the electrons, the protons, and the neutrons, and absolute atomic masses cannot be measured, but relative masses can be measured very accurately. It is actually rather common in chemistry to encounter a quantity whose magnitude can be measured only relative to some other quantity, rather than absolutely. We will encounter many other examples later in this text. In such cases,.             question:             What is a mass spectrometer used to measure?             options:             ['A. subatomic masses', 'B. partial atomic masses', 'C. optical atomic masses', 'D. relative atomic masses']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what a mass spectrometer is used to measure, let's analyze the given passage:
1. The passage explains that although the masses of subatomic particles (electrons, protons, and neutrons) are known precisely, the mass of an entire atom is not just the sum of these particles. 
2. It highlights the difference between predicted and actual masses using hydrogen and deuterium as examples, emphasizing the importance of this difference in nuclear reactions.
3. The passage states that it is not possible to measure absolute atomic masses directly.
4. Instead, scientists use a mass spectrometer to measure relative atomic masses accurately. 
5. A mass spectrometer works by first ionizing atoms or molecules, then using electric and magnetic fields to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of ions, which helps in determining their relative masses.
Considering these points, the main purpose of a mass spectrometer, as described in the passage, is to determine the relative atomic masses of atoms or molecules by measuring how much they deflect in a magnetic field compared to others with the same charge. 
Thus, the correct option is:
'D. relative atomic masses'

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. relative atomic masses'

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, let's analyze the options in the context of biology: 
1. **Subject Reproduction**: There is no recognized biological process known as "subject reproduction." This phrase does not relate to the production of genetically diverse offspring.
2. **Sexual Destruction**: This term is not used in a biological context to describe any process of reproduction. It doesn't relate to the combination of genes from two parents to produce diverse offspring.
3. **Sexual Reproduction**: This is a well-known biological process where two parents contribute genetic material to produce offspring with genetic diversity. In sexual reproduction, gametes (sperm and egg cells in humans) from two parents combine to form a new organism with a unique genetic makeup, different from both parents. This is the process that leads to genetically diverse offspring.
4. **Cellular Reproduction**: While cells reproduce through processes like mitosis and meiosis, cellular reproduction alone doesn't specifically refer to the combination of genes from two different parents. Mitosis is the division of a single cell into two identical daughter cells, and meiosis is the type of cell division that creates gametes. However, cellular reproduction as a term doesn't directly convey the combination from two different parents.
Based on this analysis, the correct

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. sexual reproduction

Q: support:             Range shifts are already being observed: for example, some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward. The same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations are not moving quickly enough. Range shifts have also been observed in plants, butterflies, other insects, freshwater fishes, reptiles, and mammals. Climate gradients will also move up mountains, eventually crowding species higher in altitude and eliminating the habitat for those species adapted to the highest elevations. Some climates will completely disappear. The rate of warming appears to be accelerated in the arctic, which is recognized as a serious threat to polar bear populations that require sea ice to hunt seals during the winter months: seals are the only source of protein available to polar bears. A trend to decreasing sea ice coverage has occurred since observations began in the mid-twentieth century. The rate of decline observed in recent years is far greater than previously predicted by climate models. Finally, global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water. Shorelines will be inundated, reducing island size, which will have an effect on some species, and a number of islands will disappear entirely. Additionally, the gradual melting and subsequent refreezing of the poles, glaciers, and higher elevation.             question:             Global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of what?             options:             ['A. warmer water', 'B. greenhouse gases', 'C. rainforests', 'D. rain']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to focus on the reasons why ocean levels will rise due to global warming, as mentioned in the provided support.
1. The statement mentions two main factors for rising ocean levels:
   - Melt water from glaciers
   - The greater volume of something caused by warming
2. The key part of the passage states: "global warming will raise ocean levels due to melt water from glaciers and the greater volume of warmer water."
3. We need to determine what property or component global warming affects that would increase its volume. As temperatures rise, water expands; this is due to thermal expansion.
Given these steps and the information from the passage, the increased volume due to warmer conditions refers directly to water.
Now, let's examine the options:
- A. Warmer water: This aligns perfectly with the concept of thermal expansion of water due to rising temperatures in the context of global warming.
- B. Greenhouse gases: These contribute to global warming but do not directly explain the rise in ocean levels due to increased volume.
- C. Rainforests: While rainforests play a role in carbon sequestration, they are not directly related to ocean volume changes.
- D. Rain: Precipitation patterns can be affected by climate change, but is

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. warmer water

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to identify the term that correctly describes "groups of young stars loosely held together by gravity."
1. **Understanding the Options:**
   - **A. constellations:** Constellations are patterns of stars as seen from Earth, typically with no physical proximity or gravitational binding among the stars.
   - **B. galaxies:** Galaxies are vast systems consisting of billions of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, bound together by gravity. This is much larger and more complex than a group of loosely bound young stars.
   - **C. closed clusters:** This option seems to refer to "globular clusters," which are tightly bound groups of old stars. The term "closed clusters" is not standard in this context.
   - **D. open clusters:** Open clusters are groups of young stars that are loosely bound together by gravity, fitting the description provided.
2. **Identifying the Correct Answer:**
   - Given the definitions above, "open clusters" match the description of "groups of young stars loosely held together by gravity."

This greatly increases the chance that fertilization will occur.             question:             What does a pollinator pick up from its body and carry directly to another plant of the same species?             options:             ['A. pathogen', 'B. seed', 'C. spore', 'D. pollen']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, let's break down the information given:

2. **Key Function of Pollinators**: According to the text, a pollinator, like a bee, picks up something on its body and carries it to another plant of the same species to aid in fertilization.
3. **What Pollinators Carry**: The passage explicitly states that animal pollinators pick up pollen on their bodies. This pollen is then transported to another plant, increasing the likelihood of fertilization.
4. **Answer Options Analysis**:
   - **A. Pathogen**: A pathogen is an organism that can cause disease. The passage does not mention pathogens in the context of what pollinators carry.
   - **B. Seed**: Seeds are the result of fertilization, not the component transported by pollinators for fertilization.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what is formed when an oxygen atom picks up a pair of hydrogen ions from a solution, we need to consider the chemical reaction involved.
1. **Understand the components involved**:
   - An oxygen atom (O) is picking up two hydrogen ions (H⁺).
2. **Chemical Reaction**:
   - Oxygen (O) can combine with two hydrogen ions (2H⁺) to form a water molecule (H₂O). This is a common reaction in chemistry.
3. **Balanced Equation**:
   - The balanced chemical equation for this process is: O + 2H⁺ → H₂O.
4. **Identify the product**:
   - The product formed from this reaction is water.
5. **Match with options**:
   - The options provided are: 'A. ammonia', 'B. water', 'C. turpentine', 'D. liquid'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to determine the result or purpose of driving turbines using steam that is produced by heating water in nuclear reactors.
1. **Understanding the process**: Nuclear reactors are used to heat water, which turns into steam. This steam is then used to drive turbines.
2. **Purpose of driving the turbines**: The main purpose of driving turbines is to produce electricity. The steam's kinetic energy turns the turbine blades, which is connected to a generator that produces electricity.
Now, let's evaluate each option based on this process:
- **A. Absorption of electricity**: The term "absorption" doesn’t fit the process as turbines and generators do not absorb electricity; they produce it.
- **B. Generation of electricity**: This option accurately describes the process. The turbines driven by steam generate electricity.
- **C. Diffusion of electricity**: "Diffusion" refers to spreading out, and while electricity does disperse through the grid, it is not the primary purpose of driving the turbines.
- **D. Depletion of electricity**: This is not relevant, as the process is about generating electricity, not depleting it.
By considering the purpose of using steam to drive turbines, the correct option is:
B. Generation

Q: support:             An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure below . In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure below looks familiar to you, that’s because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure above . If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works.             question:             What is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction?             options:             ['A. a diesel engine', 'B. an electric generator', 'C. a battery', 'D. a windmill']

2. It explains that in a generator, energy is used to turn a shaft, causing a coil of wire to rotate in a magnetic field and generate electricity. 
Now, let's evaluate the given options:
- **A. a diesel engine:** A diesel engine converts chemical energy from fuel into kinetic energy, not directly into electrical energy. It does not operate through electromagnetic induction.
- **B. an electric generator:** This matches the description exactly. It converts kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.
- **C. a battery:** A battery stores chemical energy and releases it as electrical energy, but it does not involve kinetic energy or electromagnetic induction in its basic operation.
- **D. a windmill:** A windmill converts wind energy (which can be considered a form of kinetic energy) into mechanical energy, which can then be used to generate electricity if connected to a generator, but by itself, it is not directly converting kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.
Given the explanation above, the correct answer is:
B. an electric generator.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. an electric generator'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to identify the two main types of vesicle transport within cells. 
1. **Endocytosis**: This is the process by which cells engulf external substances, bringing them into the cell enclosed in a vesicle. This allows the cell to take in nutrients, fluids, or other molecules from the outside environment.
2. **Exocytosis**: This is the opposite process, where materials contained in vesicles inside the cell are expelled to the external environment. This process is essential for removing waste materials from the cell and for sending out substances like neurotransmitters and hormones.
Given this information, the correct types of vesicle transport are endocytosis and exocytosis.
Thus, the correct option is: **B. endocytosis and exocytosis**.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. endocytosis and exocytosis

Q: support:             Life is complex, and there are millions of species alive today. Many millions more lived in the past and then went extinct. Organisms include microscopic, single-celled organisms. They also include complex, multicellular animals such as you. Clearly, life science is a huge science. That’s why a life scientist usually specializes in just one field within life science. Dr. Smith, for example, specializes in ecology. You can see the focus of ecology and several other life science fields in Table below . Click on the links provided if you want to learn about careers in these fields.             question:             What do you call a species that has died out in the past?             options:             ['A. extinct', 'B. remnant', 'C. endangered', 'D. inhabit']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what you call a species that has died out in the past, let's consider the definitions of the options provided:
- **A. Extinct**: When a species has no living members left, it is considered extinct. This means that the species has died out completely.
  
- **B. Remnant**: This term usually refers to a small remaining quantity of something or a reduced, surviving group from a larger population or thing.
  
- **C. Endangered**: This is a term used for species that are at risk of becoming extinct in the near future but still have some living members.
  
- **D. Inhabit**: This is a verb that means to live in or occupy a place. It does not apply to a species that has died out.
  
Since the question specifically asks about a species that "has died out in the past," the correct term to use is "extinct." Thus, the appropriate choice is:
**A. Extinct**

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. Extinct.

This was the first feature to evolve that separated plants from green algae. This is also the only adaptation shared by all plants.             question:             Where does the embryo develop in a plant?             options:             ['A. inside the male plant after fertilization', 'B. inside the stem after fertilization', 'C. inside the female plant after fertilization', 'D. outside the female plant after fertilization']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the embryo develops in a plant, let's analyze the provided information:
1. It states that in plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization. This specific mention indicates the location of embryo development in plants.
2. Comparing this to algae, we see a distinguishing feature highlighted: algae release their embryo into the water rather than retaining it inside. This difference reinforces the unique characteristic of plant embryo development inside the female plant.
With this understanding, the correct option is:
C. inside the female plant after fertilization.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. inside the female plant after fertilization.

Q: support:             When using measuring devices, we often use a technique called calibration to increase the accuracy of our measurements. Calibration is a method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards. To better understand calibration, we will look at the example of calibrating a thermometer. All thermometers are slightly different in their temperature readings. One way to calibrate a thermometer is by using the freezing point and boiling point of water ( Figure below ). If we know that water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C, we can calibrate our thermometer by measuring the temperature of ice water and of boiling water. We place the thermometer in ice water and wait for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, then place a mark at this height which represents 0°C. Then we place the thermometer in boiling water, and after waiting for the thermometer liquid to reach a stable height, we place a mark at this height which represents 100°C. We can then place 100 equally spaced divisions between our 0 and 100°C marks to each represent 1°C. Our thermometer has now been calibrated using the known values for the freezing point and boiling point of water, and can be used to measure temperatures of objects between 0 and 100°C.             question:             What is the method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards called?             options:             ['A. distortion', 'B. calibration', 'C. precision', 'D. parallax']
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the correct answer, we need to evaluate the question: "What is the method of setting or correcting a measuring device by matching it to known measurement standards called?"
1. **Understanding the context**: The method refers to the process described in the passage where a thermometer is adjusted or corrected based on known temperature points (freezing and boiling points of water).
2. **Definitions of options**:
   - **A. Distortion**: This usually refers to an alteration of the original shape or other characteristics of an object or image.
   - **B. Calibration**: This is the process of adjusting the precision of a measuring instrument by aligning it with known measurement standards, which perfectly describes the situation in the passage.
   - **C. Precision**: This pertains to the consistency or repeatability of measurements but doesn't involve adjusting the instrument based on standards.
   - **D. Parallax**: This refers to the apparent change in position of an object when viewed from different angles, not related to measurement calibration.
3. **Matching definition to context**: Considering the passage and the process it describes, where a thermometer is calibrated using known points (freezing and boiling points of water), the option that best matches is "B. Calibration".
Thus, the correct

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'B. calibration'.

Q: support:             The warm-air vent is placed near the floor of the room. Warm air is less dense than cold air so it rises. If the warm-air vent were placed near the ceiling instead, how would this affect the transfer of thermal energy throughout the room?.             question:             What property of warm air causes it to rise above cold air?             options:             ['A. greater density', 'B. lower density', 'C. higher temperature', 'D. greater pressure']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why warm air rises above cold air, we can analyze the properties of air related to temperature:
1. **Density**: Warm air is generally less dense than cold air. This difference in density is a crucial factor in the movement of air. When the air is heated, it expands and the same amount of air occupies a larger volume. This results in a decrease in density, causing the warm air to rise above the denser, colder air.
2. **Temperature**: While the temperature of warm air is indeed higher, it's the effect of this higher temperature (which is primarily the reduction in density) that causes the air to rise, rather than the temperature itself causing the movement directly.
3. **Pressure**: Increasing temperature can lead to increased pressure if volume is restricted, but in a room with a vent (where air can move), the pressure isn't the determining factor for why warm air rises.
Given these points, the primary property of warm air that causes it to rise above cold air is its "lower density" compared to cold air.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. lower density.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. lower density.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to refer to the information provided in the support statement. The statement clearly mentions that "one horsepower is the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute." This indicates that the unit of measure for the amount of work a horse can do in 1 minute is defined as "horsepower."
Now, let's look at the options provided:
- A. joule: Joules are a unit of energy or work, not specifically tied to the work of a horse in 1 minute.
- B. torque: Torque is a measure of rotational force, not directly related to the work done by a horse in this context.
- C. watt: Watts are a unit of power, used to express how fast work is done. While watts can measure power like horsepower, the question asks for the specific unit equal to the work of a horse in 1 minute.
- D. horsepower: According to the support statement, this is explicitly defined as the unit equal to the work a horse can do in 1 minute.
Thus, the correct answer is D. horsepower.

Digestion takes place in the digestive cavity. Nutrients are absorbed and gases are exchanged through the cells lining this cavity. Fluid in the cavity supports and stiffens the cnidarian body.             question:             What organism is characterized by an incomplete digestive system and a single, tentacled opening?             options:             ['A. annelids', 'B. sponges', 'C. prokaryotes', 'D. cnidarians']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which organism is characterized by an incomplete digestive system with a single, tentacled opening, we need to analyze the characteristics provided in the support text and match them with the options given.
1. Incomplete digestive system with a single opening: This indicates that the organism uses the same opening for both the intake of food and the expulsion of waste.
2. The opening is surrounded by tentacles: These tentacles are specialized for capturing prey and are typically equipped with nematocyst cells, which are unique to certain organisms.
3. Fluids in the cavity support and stiffen the organism's body.
Now, let's analyze the options:
- A. Annelids: These are segmented worms, like earthworms, and they have a complete digestive system with both a mouth and an anus, so this does not match.
- B. Sponges: Although sponges have an incomplete digestive system because they also lack a true mouth and anus, they do not possess tentacles with nematocysts, so this does not match.
- C. Prokaryotes: These are unicellular organisms, such as bacteria, and they do not have complex structures like a digestive system or tentacles. This option does not match.
- D. Cnidarians:

Q: support:             The second equation is equivalent to the first. Voltage is not the same as energy. Voltage is the energy per unit charge. Thus a motorcycle battery and a car battery can both have the same voltage (more precisely, the same potential difference between battery terminals), yet one stores much more energy than the other since ΔPE = qΔV . The car battery can move more charge than the motorcycle battery, although both are 12 V batteries.             question:             What term is not the same as energy, but means the energy per unit charge?             options:             ['A. speed', 'B. mass', 'C. frequency', 'D. voltage']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct term, let's analyze the provided support:
1. The statement begins by explaining that voltage is not the same as energy but is described as the "energy per unit charge."
2. The support highlights that both a motorcycle and a car battery can have the same voltage, which indicates the same potential difference, even if their stored energies differ.
Given these points, the question asks for the term that represents "energy per unit charge."
- Option A (speed) does not relate to energy or charge.
- Option B (mass) is a measure of matter, not energy per unit charge.
- Option C (frequency) relates to how often events occur, not directly involving energy per unit charge.
- Option D (voltage) corresponds directly to the description provided: it's the energy per unit charge.
Therefore, the term that is "energy per unit charge" is voltage. 
The correct answer is: **D. voltage**.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which part of the African violet is used for propagation, we need to understand the process of propagation for this type of plant.
1. **Propagation Method**: African violets are commonly propagated through vegetative means, which involve using parts of the plant to grow new plants without sexual reproduction.
2. **Common Parts Used in Plant Propagation**:
   - **Leaves**: Many houseplants, including African violets, can be propagated by leaf cuttings. This involves cutting a healthy leaf along with its petiole (the stalk that attaches the leaf to the stem) and placing it in soil or water to encourage root development and eventually grow a new plant.
   - **Petals**: Petals are part of the flower primarily involved in reproduction through attracting pollinators, not typically used for propagation.
   - **Spores**: Spores are associated with ferns and fungi, not flowering plants like African violets.
   - **Roots**: While roots can form new plants in some species, leaf cuttings are the standard method for African violets.
3. Based on this understanding, the part of the African violet used for propagation is the "leaves."
Therefore, the answer is option C: leaves.

A: Let's think step by step.
To identify the fibers that depend on aerobic respiration, we need to understand what aerobic respiration involves. Aerobic respiration is a process that requires oxygen to produce energy (ATP). It occurs in the mitochondria of cells and is the primary method by which muscles that rely on sustained, long-duration activities generate energy.
Now, let's look at the options:
- A. Oxidative fibers: "Oxidative" refers to the use of oxygen ("oxi" being the root related to oxygen). These fibers use aerobic respiration to generate energy, making them more fatigue-resistant. They are efficient for prolonged activities and are also known as slow-twitch fibers or Type I fibers.
- B. Evaporative fibers: Evaporation refers to the process of a liquid turning into vapor, which is unrelated to aerobic respiration. This option does not fit our context.
- C. Hydrogen fibers: This term does not relate to muscle fibers or aerobic respiration. It does not fit the context of muscle physiology.
- D. Fragile fibers: This term does not specifically describe a type of muscle fiber related to aerobic respiration.
Given this analysis, the correct answer is "A. oxidative fibers," as these are the muscle fibers that predominantly rely on aerobic respiration for energy production.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. oxidative fibers

High-frequency waves have a lot of energy and are potentially very harmful.             question:             Which form of electromagnetic waves have more energy: low frequency wave or high frequency waves?             options:             ['A. low frequency waves', 'B. high frequency waves', 'C. the same', 'D. neither']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which form of electromagnetic waves has more energy, we refer to the relationship between energy and frequency in electromagnetic waves. 
1. The energy of electromagnetic waves is directly proportional to their frequency. This means that the higher the frequency of the wave, the more energy it carries.
2. Low-frequency waves, such as radio waves, have relatively little energy and are typically not harmful. Examples of low-frequency waves include radio waves and microwaves.
3. High-frequency waves, such as X-rays and gamma rays, have a lot of energy and are potentially very harmful because their high energy levels can penetrate materials and cause damage at the molecular or cellular level.
From this analysis, we can conclude that high-frequency waves carry more energy than low-frequency waves.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. high frequency waves

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. high frequency waves

The question is asking what living things need to survive. Based on the context, the most direct and relevant answer is "D. nutrients," as it specifically highlights that living things need them and connects this need to the proximity to shore and availability in the water. 
While oxygen is indeed necessary for many living things, the passage does not mention it, and we should focus on the details provided. The same logic applies to heat and molecules which, although important, are not mentioned in the context. Therefore, the correct answer is "D. nutrients."

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is "D. nutrients."

Q: support:             Some regions of the electron cloud are denser than others. The denser regions are areas where electrons are most likely to be. These regions are called orbitals . Each orbital has a maximum of just two electrons. Different energy levels in the cloud have different numbers of orbitals. Therefore, different energy levels have different maximum numbers of electrons. Table below lists the number of orbitals and electrons for the first four energy levels. Energy levels farther from the nucleus have more orbitals. Therefore, these levels can hold more electrons.             question:             The denser regions of the electron cloud are called what?             options:             ['A. cores', 'B. isotopes', 'C. orbitals', 'D. lattices']

Q: support:             6.3 The Laws of Thermodynamics In studying energy, scientists use the term “system” to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers. Everything outside of the system is called the surroundings. Single cells are biological systems. Systems can be thought of as having a certain amount of order. It takes energy to make a system more ordered. The more ordered a system is, the lower its entropy. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. As a system becomes more disordered, the lower its energy and the higher its entropy become. A series of laws, called the laws of thermodynamics, describe the properties and processes of energy transfer. The first law states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. This means that energy can’t be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. The second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy, resulting in a more disordered system. In other words, no energy transfer is completely efficient and tends toward disorder.             question:             In studying energy, what term do scientists use to refer to the matter and its environment involved in energy transfers?             options:             ['A. world', 'B. system', 'C. molecule', 'D. ecosystem']
A: Let's think step by step.

Q: support:             (a) Initially, the system (a copper penny and concentrated nitric acid) is at atmospheric pressure. (b) When the penny is added to the nitric acid, the volume of NO2 gas that is formed causes the piston to move upward to maintain the system at atmospheric pressure. In doing so, the system is performing work on its surroundings. The symbol E in represents the internal energy of a system, which is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy of all its components. It is the change in internal energy that produces heat plus work. To measure the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions, chemists usually use a related thermodynamic quantity calledenthalpy (H) (from the Greek enthalpein, meaning “to warm”). The enthalpy of a system is defined as the sum of its internal energy E plus the product of its pressure Pand volume V:.             question:             To measure what changes that occur in chemical reactions, chemists usually use a related thermodynamic quantity, calledenthalpy?             options:             ['A. evaporation', 'B. energy', 'C. ion exchange', 'D. entropy']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking about what changes are measured using enthalpy in chemical reactions. Based on the provided context:
1. **Understanding what enthalpy is**: Enthalpy (H) is a thermodynamic quantity that reflects the total heat content of a system. It is defined as the sum of the internal energy (E) and the product of pressure (P) and volume (V) of the system.
2. **What enthalpy measures**: Enthalpy is used to measure energy changes in chemical reactions. It accounts for heat exchange at constant pressure.
3. **Given options**:
   - A. Evaporation: This is a physical process, not directly related to enthalpy in general chemical reaction contexts.
   - B. Energy: This is correct because enthalpy is used to measure changes in the energy content of a system during a chemical reaction.
   - C. Ion exchange: This is a specific type of reaction or process, not what enthalpy directly measures.
   - D. Entropy: This is another thermodynamic concept related to disorder, not directly measured by enthalpy.
Considering the context and understanding of enthalpy, the correct answer is:
B. energy

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which state a system cannot spontaneously change and therefore can do no work, we need to consider the characteristics of each option:
1. **A. Equilibrium:** In this state, a system is balanced with no net flow of energy or matter. Since all forces or influences are balanced, the system does not change spontaneously. It is a state where the potential to do work is zero because there are no unbalanced forces to drive any process. 
2. **B. Stability:** Stability generally refers to the ability of a system to return to equilibrium after a disturbance. It is a characteristic that may describe how a system behaves but does not specify that the system cannot do work.
3. **C. Equality:** This term generally refers to mathematical or value-based comparisons and is not typically used in physics to describe a system state that cannot change spontaneously.
4. **D. Balance:** Balance implies an equal distribution or arrangement, similar to equilibrium, but is less specifically defined in terms of thermodynamic or system states.
Considering the above explanations, the term that most accurately describes a system that cannot spontaneously change and therefore can do no work is **"A. equilibrium."** In equilibrium, all conditions such as temperature, pressure, and concentration are uniform, and there is no tendency

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'A. equilibrium'

Q: support:             Some predator species are known as keystone species. A keystone species is one that plays an especially important role in its community. Major changes in the numbers of a keystone species affect the populations of many other species in the community. For example, some sea star species are keystone species in coral reef communities. The sea stars prey on mussels and sea urchins, which have no other natural predators. If sea stars were removed from a coral reef community, mussel and sea urchin populations would have explosive growth. This, in turn, would drive out most other species. In the end, the coral reef community would be destroyed.             question:             What is a species that plays an especially important role in it's community called?             options:             ['A. keystone', 'B. complement', 'C. Leader', 'D. Invasive']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which term accurately describes a species that plays an especially significant role in its community, we need to review the information provided:
1. The information defines a "keystone species" as one that is crucial in its community.
2. The passage explains that major changes in the population of a keystone species affect many other species within the community.
3. It provides an example involving sea stars, which are identified as keystone species in coral reef communities. The removal of sea stars (keystone species) would lead to unchecked growth of mussels and sea urchins and ultimately harm the entire coral reef ecosystem.
Given this explanation, we can conclude that the term for a species that plays an exceptionally important role in its community is a "keystone species."
Now, let's examine the provided options to find which one represents this concept:
- A. keystone
- B. complement
- C. Leader
- D. Invasive
Option A, "keystone," matches the definition provided in the passage. The other options do not fit the described role of significantly affecting other species within a community.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
- A. keystone

Q: support:             The population growth rate is how fast a population is growing. The letter r stands for the growth rate. The growth rate equals the number of new members added to the population in a year for each 100 members already in the population. The growth rate includes new members added to the population and old members removed from the population. Births add new members to the population. Deaths remove members from the population. The formula for population growth rate is:.             question:             What term that shows how fast a population is growing includes new members added to the population over a given period, as well as old members removed from the population?             options:             ['A. emigration', 'B. growth rate', 'C. birth rate', 'D. population density']
A: Let's think step by step.
1. **Understand the question**: The question asks for a term that describes the rate at which a population is growing, which includes both new members being added (e.g., through births) and old members being removed (e.g., through deaths).
2. **Review the support information**: According to the passage, the term "growth rate" stands for how fast a population is growing. It specifically includes the calculation of new members added and old members removed. This aligns with the question's requirements.
3. **Evaluate the options**:
   - **A. Emigration**: This term typically refers to individuals leaving a population, not both additions and removals.
   - **B. Growth rate**: This is explicitly defined in the passage as including both new additions and removals, which is what the question describes.
   - **C. Birth rate**: This only covers new individuals being added through births and does not account for removals.
   - **D. Population density**: Refers to the number of individuals within a certain area, not the change over time or rates of addition/removal.
4. **Conclusion**: The most appropriate term, considering the question and the provided explanation, is "B. growth rate."

The simplest class of organic compounds is the hydrocarbons, which consist entirely of carbon and hydrogen. Petroleum and natural gas are complex, naturally occurring mixtures of many different hydrocarbons that furnish raw materials for the chemical industry. The four major classes of hydrocarbons are the alkanes, which contain only carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon single bonds; the alkenes, which contain at least one carbon–carbon double bond; the alkynes, which contain at least one carbon–carbon triple bond; and the aromatic hydrocarbons, which usually contain rings of six carbon atoms that can be drawn with alternating single and double bonds. Alkanes are also called saturated hydrocarbons, whereas hydrocarbons that contain multiple bonds (alkenes, alkynes, and aromatics) are unsaturated.             question:             The simplest class of organic compounds is the what?             options:             ['A. gas', 'B. hydrocarbons', 'C. particles', 'D.

Q: support:             The trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity. As with the previously discussed nerve tracts, the sensory pathways of the trigeminal pathway each involve three successive neurons. First, axons from the trigeminal ganglion enter the brain stem at the level of the pons. These axons project to one of three locations. The spinal trigeminal nucleus of the medulla receives information similar to that carried by spinothalamic tract, such as pain and temperature sensations. Other axons go to either the chief sensory nucleus in the pons or the mesencephalic nuclei in the midbrain. These nuclei receive information like that carried by the dorsal column system, such as touch, pressure, vibration, and proprioception. Axons from the second neuron decussate and ascend to the thalamus along the trigeminothalamic tract. In the thalamus, each axon synapses with the third neuron in its respective pathway. Axons from the third neuron then project from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex of the cerebrum. The sensory pathway for gustation travels along the facial and glossopharyngeal cranial nerves, which synapse with neurons of the solitary nucleus in the brain stem. Axons from the solitary nucleus then project to the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus. Finally, axons from the ventral posterior nucleus project to the gustatory cortex of the cerebral cortex, where taste is processed and consciously perceived. The sensory pathway for audition travels along the vestibulocochlear nerve, which synapses with neurons in the cochlear nuclei of the superior medulla. Within the brain stem, input from either ear is combined to extract location information from the auditory stimuli. Whereas the initial auditory stimuli received at the cochlea strictly represent the frequency—or pitch—of the stimuli, the locations of sounds can be determined by comparing information arriving at both ears.             question:             Which pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity?             options:             ['A. dual pathway', 'B. cranial pathway', 'C. trigeminal pathway', 'D. posterior pathway']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity, we can analyze the given information.
1. The question asks specifically about somatosensory information which typically involves sensations such as touch, pressure, pain, temperature, vibration, and proprioception.
2. From the support provided, it states: "The trigeminal pathway carries somatosensory information from the face, head, mouth, and nasal cavity."
3. Comparing the options provided:
   - A. dual pathway: This is not mentioned in the context.
   - B. cranial pathway: This is a generic term and not specifically mentioned.
   - C. trigeminal pathway: This matches the statement in the support which directly states that the trigeminal pathway is responsible for carrying somatosensory information from the specified regions.
   - D. posterior pathway: This pathway is not mentioned in relation to somatosensory information from these parts.
Thus, the correct answer is C. trigeminal pathway.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'C. trigeminal pathway'.

Q: support:             The story is quite different for gases. Gases take the shape of their container, and they are relatively easy to compress. There are fewer gas particles per unit volume than for the same substance in the liquid or solid form. In fact, the liquid form of a given material is generally several hundred times more dense than the gas form at normal pressures. Despite the large amounts of empty space, a sample of a gas contains many particles moving around, colliding and imparting force on their surroundings. For example, in a one mole sample of gas at 0°C and 1 atm of pressure, each cubic centimeter contains roughly 2.7 × 10 19 molecules. Each molecule participates in several billion collisions every second, moving only about 10-100 nanometers between collisions. Additionally, these gas particles move at very high speeds. For example, at 25°C, the average speed of hydrogen molecules in a sample of hydrogen gas is 1960 m/s.             question:             What take the shape of their container, and are relatively easy to compress?             options:             ['A. fluids', 'B. molecules', 'C. gases', 'D. semi-fluids']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we should first identify what is being described in the statement. The statement mentions that "gases take the shape of their container, and they are relatively easy to compress." We need to find the option that corresponds to these characteristics.
1. **Fluid**: While fluids, which include both liquids and gases, can take the shape of their container, liquids are not easy to compress. Gases, however, are easy to compress.
2. **Molecules**: Molecules are individual particles and do not take the shape of a container themselves. They are the basic components of substances but do not describe a state of matter like gas or liquid.
3. **Gases**: Gases are indeed known for taking the shape of their container. They have no fixed shape or volume and are easy to compress, as stated in the passage.
4. **Semi-fluids**: This term is not commonly used in scientific contexts and likely refers to something between a solid and a liquid, but it's not applicable in the context of the passage.
Based on this analysis, the option that best matches the description in the question is "C. gases."
Thus, the correct answer is: C. gases.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is C. gases.

A: Let's think step by step.
Gene therapy often targets bone marrow cells due to their ability to provide long-term and sustained effects in the body. To determine the ideal property of bone marrow cells for gene therapy, let's examine the options:
- **A. Lifelong reproduction**: Bone marrow contains stem cells which have the capability to self-renew and differentiate into various blood cell types throughout an individual's life. This ability ensures that the effects of gene therapy, including the correction of genetic abnormalities, can be maintained over a long period.
- **B. Matching**: This typically refers to the need for tissue compatibility in transplant situations, which is less relevant to the inherent properties making bone marrow ideal for gene therapy.
- **C. Behavior reproduction**: This term is not commonly associated with the biological characteristics of bone marrow cells.
- **D. Irreversible reproduction**: This is not a typical biological term in the context of cell reproduction. Irreversible processes would not facilitate the continuous renewal needed for successful long-term gene therapy effects.
Given these considerations, the key property that makes bone marrow cells ideal for gene therapy is their capability for lifelong reproduction. This enables stable and enduring therapeutic outcomes following gene modification.
Therefore, the correct answer is: **A. lifelong reproduction**.

Q: support:             Catabolic Reactions Catabolic reactions break down large organic molecules into smaller molecules, releasing the energy contained in the chemical bonds. These energy releases (conversions) are not 100 percent efficient. The amount of energy released is less than the total amount contained in the molecule. Approximately 40 percent of energy yielded from catabolic reactions is directly transferred to the high-energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP, the energy currency of cells, can be used immediately to power molecular machines that support cell, tissue, and organ function. This includes building new tissue and repairing damaged tissue. ATP can also be stored to fulfill future energy demands. The remaining 60 percent of the energy released from catabolic reactions is given off as heat, which tissues and body fluids absorb. Structurally, ATP molecules consist of an adenine, a ribose, and three phosphate groups (Figure 24.2). The chemical bond between the second and third phosphate groups, termed a high-energy bond, represents the greatest source of energy in a cell. It is the first bond that catabolic enzymes break when cells require energy to do work. The products of this reaction are a molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a lone phosphate group (Pi). ATP, ADP, and Pi are constantly being cycled through reactions that build ATP and store energy, and reactions that break down ATP and release energy.             question:             Catabolic reactions break down large organic molecules into smaller molecules, releasing the energy contained in what?             options:             ['A. molecular bonds', 'B. chemical bonds', 'C. crystals bonds', 'D. liquid bonds']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided.
The passage describes catabolic reactions as processes that break down large organic molecules into smaller ones. During this breakdown, energy is released from the molecules.
It is specifically mentioned that this energy comes from "chemical bonds." The passage doesn't refer to "molecular bonds," "crystal bonds," or "liquid bonds."
Therefore, based on the information given, the energy comes from "chemical bonds."
So, the correct answer is:

Q: support:             Climate change in Earth history was due to natural processes. Recent global warming is due mainly to human actions. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the air. This creates greater greenhouse effect and global warming.             question:             While climate change in earth history was due to natural processes, what is primarily to blame for recent global warming?             options:             ['A. volcanos', 'B. wars', 'C. human actions', 'D. factories']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to understand the distinction between historical climate change and recent global warming.
1. **Historical Context**: In Earth's history, climate change has been driven by natural processes. These include volcanic eruptions, changes in solar radiation, natural greenhouse gas emissions, and other geophysical phenomena.
2. **Recent Context**: The passage specifically mentions that recent global warming is mainly due to human actions. These actions are primarily related to the burning of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. This enhances the greenhouse effect, leading to an increase in Earth's average temperature.
3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **Option A: Volcanos** - While volcanic activity can release greenhouse gases and affect climate, the passage indicates that recent warming is due to human actions, not volcanos.
   - **Option B: Wars** - Wars can have environmental impacts, but they are not the primary driver of global warming.
   - **Option C: Human actions** - This fits the explanation given in the passage about recent global warming.
   - **Option D: Factories** - Factories contribute to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, but the passage emphasizes human actions more broadly, not just factories.
Given these

Q: support:             Watch this short video (http://openstaxcollege. org/l/transgenic) explaining how scientists create a transgenic animal. Although the classic methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: "What does this gene or DNA element do?" This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classical genetic methodology. One example of this method is analogous to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the wing’s function is flight. The classic genetic method compares insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observes that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly in a reverse genetics approach, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. Alternately, reverse genetics can be used to cause a gene to overexpress itself to determine what phenotypic effects may occur.             question:             Which kind of genetics approach involves mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function?             options:             ['A. impossible genetics', 'B. inverse genetics', 'C. possible genetics', 'D. reverse genetics']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's review the provided text and consider the concept it describes.
1. The text explains modern genetic techniques that allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level to determine the function of genes, which is referred to as reverse genetics.
2. In reverse genetics, researchers mutate or delete genes to assess the effects on phenotype, which helps to give clues about gene function. The text provides an analogy of damaging a body part to understand its function.
3. Based on the description of reverse genetics in the text, it matches the technique involving mutating or deleting genes to understand gene function.
Now, let's look at the provided options:
- A. impossible genetics
- B. inverse genetics
- C. possible genetics
- D. reverse genetics
From the options, "D. reverse genetics" aligns with the explanation provided in the text about the method of mutating or deleting genes to gain insights into their function.
Therefore, the correct answer is "D. reverse genetics".

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'D. reverse genetics'.

Q: support:             Obesity With obesity at high rates in the United States, there is a public health focus on reducing obesity and associated health risks, which include diabetes, colon and breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease. How does the food consumed contribute to obesity? Fatty foods are calorie-dense, meaning that they have more calories per unit mass than carbohydrates or proteins. One gram of carbohydrates has four calories, one gram of protein has four calories, and one gram of fat has nine calories. Animals tend to seek lipid-rich food for their higher energy content. Greater amounts of food energy taken in than the body’s requirements will result in storage of the excess in fat deposits. Excess carbohydrate is used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. When glycogen stores are full, additional glucose is converted into fatty acids. These fatty acids are stored in adipose tissue cells—the fat cells in the mammalian body whose primary role is to store fat for later use. The rate of obesity among children is rapidly rising in the United States. To combat childhood obesity and ensure that children get a healthy start in life, in 2010 First Lady Michelle Obama launched the Let’s Move! campaign. The goal of this campaign is to educate parents and caregivers on providing healthy nutrition and encouraging active lifestyles in future generations. This program aims to involve the entire community, including parents, teachers, and healthcare providers to ensure that children have access to healthy foods—more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains—and consume fewer calories from processed foods. Another goal is to ensure that children get physical activity. With the increase in television viewing and stationary pursuits such as video games, sedentary lifestyles have become the norm.

A: Let's think step by step.
The question is asking about the purpose for which the liver uses excess carbohydrates. Based on the provided support:
- The text mentions that fatty foods are calorie-dense and that excess carbohydrates are used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. It also explains that when glycogen stores are full, additional glucose from carbohydrates is converted into fatty acids and stored in fat cells.
Focusing on the specific part where it talks about the liver's role, we can see:
- "Excess carbohydrate is used by the liver to synthesize glycogen."
Thus, the correct purpose for which the liver uses excess carbohydrate is to synthesize glycogen. 
Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. to synthesize glycogen

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is A. to synthesize glycogen

Q: support:             Saturn’s composition is similar to Jupiter's. The planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. These elements are gases in the outer layers and liquids in the deeper layers. Saturn may also have a small solid core. Saturn's upper atmosphere has clouds in bands of different colors. These clouds rotate rapidly around the planet. But Saturn has fewer storms than Jupiter. Thunder and lightning have been seen in the storms on Saturn ( Figure below ).             question:             Saturn is made mostly of helium and what else?             options:             ['A. hydrogen', 'B. hydrogen', 'C. carbon', 'D. nitrogen']
A: Let's think step by step.
To find out what Saturn is mostly made of, we need to refer to the information provided about its composition. According to the support information, Saturn is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Therefore, we're looking for an option that includes hydrogen along with helium.
Now, let's evaluate the options provided:
- A. hydrogen
- B. hydrogen
- C. carbon
- D. nitrogen
Both options A and B mention hydrogen, which aligns with the information that Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Options C (carbon) and D (nitrogen) do not match the description given in the support statement.
Therefore, the correct answer is either option A or B, as both are "hydrogen." Since both options are identical and the typical style is to choose the single correct answer, we would select:
- A. hydrogen 
Ultimately, the answer to the question is that Saturn is made mostly of helium and hydrogen.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is 'A. hydrogen'.

Q: support:             Alkenes Organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms are described as unsaturated. You have likely heard of unsaturated fats. These are complex organic molecules with long chains of carbon atoms, which contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms. Unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules that contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Carbon atoms linked by a double bond are bound together by two bonds, one σ bond and one π bond. Double and triple bonds give rise to a different geometry around the carbon atom that participates in them, leading to important differences in molecular shape and properties. The differing geometries are responsible for the different properties of unsaturated versus saturated fats. Ethene, C2H4, is the simplest alkene. Each carbon atom in ethene, commonly called ethylene, has a trigonal planar structure. The second member of the series is propene (propylene) (Figure 20.7); the butene isomers follow in the series. Four carbon atoms in the chain of butene allows for the formation of isomers based on the position of the double bond, as well as a new form of isomerism.             question:             What are alkenes organic compounds that contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms described as?             options:             ['A. strong', 'B. unsaturated', 'C. insulated', 'D. saturated']
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, we need to determine the correct description of alkenes among the given options.
1. Alkenes are a type of organic compound.
2. Alkenes contain one or more double or triple bonds between carbon atoms.
3. Organic compounds that contain double or triple bonds between carbon atoms are described as "unsaturated."
Based on these steps, alkenes are described as "unsaturated" organic compounds.
Now, let's review the provided options:
- A. strong
- B. unsaturated
- C. insulated
- D. saturated
From the explanation, option B, "unsaturated," correctly describes alkenes. Therefore, the answer is:
B. unsaturated

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. unsaturated

Q: support:             The two materials do have at least one thing in common. The atoms in the materials are held together by covalent bonds. These bonds consist of electrons shared between two or more atoms. Unlike ionic bonds, where electrons are either lost or gained by an atom to form charged ions, electrons in covalent compounds are shared between the two atoms, giving rise to properties that are quite different from those seen in ionic materials.             question:             Electrons in covalent compounds are shared between the two atoms, unlike the case in what type of bonds?             options:             ['A. horizontal bonds', 'B. ionic bonds', 'C. soluble bonds', 'D. weak bonds']
A: Let's think step by step.
In the given support information, we are informed about the nature of covalent bonds, where electrons are shared between atoms. This is contrasted with ionic bonds, where electrons are transferred from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of charged ions. The key difference pointed out is that while covalent bonds involve sharing electrons, ionic bonds involve the loss or gain of electrons.
So, the question is asking about the type of bonds where electrons are not shared, as opposed to covalent bonds. Based on the explanation, the type of bonds where this occurs is ionic bonds.
Let's evaluate the options provided:
- A. Horizontal bonds: This option doesn't relate to chemical bonding types.
- B. Ionic bonds: This is aligned with the explanation given. Ionic bonds are the ones where electrons are lost or gained, rather than shared.
- C. Soluble bonds: This is not a standard term for a type of chemical bond.
- D. Weak bonds: This doesn't specifically refer to a difference in electron sharing like ionic bonds do.
Therefore, the correct answer would be option B. Ionic bonds.

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. Ionic bonds.

Q: support:             Viscosity (η) is the resistance of a liquid to flow. Some liquids, such as gasoline, ethanol, and water, flow very readily and hence have a low viscosity. Others, such as motor oil, molasses, and maple syrup, flow very slowly and have a high viscosity. The two most common methods for evaluating the viscosity of a liquid are (1) to measure the time it takes for a quantity of liquid to flow through a narrow vertical tube and (2) to measure the time it takes steel balls to fall through a given volume of the liquid. The higher the viscosity, the slower the liquid flows through the tube and the steel balls fall. Viscosity is expressed in units of the poise (mPa·s); the higher the number, the higher the viscosity. The viscosities of some representative liquids are listed in Table 11.4 "Surface Tension, Viscosity, Vapor Pressure (at 25°C Unless Otherwise Indicated), and Normal Boiling Points of Common Liquids" and show a correlation between viscosity and intermolecular forces. Because a liquid can flow only if the molecules can move past one another with minimal resistance, strong intermolecular attractive forces make it more difficult for molecules to move with respect to one another. The addition of a second hydroxyl group to ethanol, for example, which produces ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH), increases the viscosity 15-fold. This effect is due to the increased number of hydrogen bonds that can form between hydroxyl groups in adjacent molecules, resulting in dramatically stronger intermolecular attractive forces.             question:             What is the resistance of a liquid to flow called?             options:             ['A. turbulence', 'B. viscosity', 'C. elasticity', 'D. permeability']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the resistance of a liquid to flow is called, let's review the provided information:
1. The passage defines viscosity as the resistance of a liquid to flow.
2. Viscosity relates to how easily or slowly a liquid flows based on its resistance.
3. It mentions that low viscosity liquids (e.g., gasoline, ethanol, water) flow readily, whereas high viscosity liquids (e.g., motor oil, molasses) flow slowly.
Based on this, we can identify that viscosity is the term used to describe the resistance of a liquid to flow. Let's match this with the provided options:
- A. turbulence: This refers to irregular or chaotic flow in fluids, not resistance to flow.
- B. viscosity: This is the correct term for resistance to flow, as explained in the passage.
- C. elasticity: This describes the ability of a material to return to its original shape after deformation, which is unrelated to fluid flow.
- D. permeability: This refers to the ability of a material to allow fluids to pass through it, which is also unrelated to a liquid's resistance to flow.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. viscosity

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is B. viscosity

A: Let's think step by step.
To find the answer to the question, we need to revisit the statement provided in the support:
"Atoms have a mass that is based largely on the number of protons and neutrons in their nucleus."
Now, let's break down the information:
1. **Atoms** - This is the subject of the statement.
2. **Mass** - We are trying to understand what determines the mass of atoms.
3. **Protons and Neutrons** - These are the particles mentioned as largely contributing to the mass of atoms.
4. **Nucleus** - The location within the atom where protons and neutrons reside.
The question asks where the number of protons and neutrons, which determine the mass of atoms, are located. The support statement clearly states that these particles are in the "nucleus".
So, let's look at the options:
- A. molecules
- B. electrons
- C. components
- D. nucleus 
The statement specifies the location as "nucleus". Therefore, the correct answer is:
D. nucleus

Therefore, among A through D, the answer is D. nucleus
