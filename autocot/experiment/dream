He mentions that supermarkets outside the city are cheaper and offers to pick up anything she needs. 2. **The woman's response**: The woman expresses her reluctance to let anyone else drive her car (\"I don't like to let anyone else drive my car\"). 3. **Her solution**: She suggests an alternative by saying, \"Tell you what, why don't we go together?\" Based on her response, the woman is not willing to lend her car, but she offers to go to the supermarket with the man instead. She implies that she will drive instead of allowing him to use her car by suggesting they go together. Now, let's analyze the options: A.

Where are you heading with that big bag? W: I'm offto the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know. M: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? W: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. M: I see. W: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? M: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. W: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? M: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV W: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. M: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. W: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime? M: Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that.             question:             What do you know about the man?             options:             A. He likes cycling very much. B. He plays baseball regularly now. C. He exercises regularly.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what we know about the man based on the dialogue, let's analyze the relevant parts of their conversation: 1. **Cycling**: The man mentions, \"I go cycling sometimes too\", which indicates that he does enjoy cycling occasionally but doesn't suggest that he does it very frequently or passionately. Thus, the option \"He likes cycling very much\" may not be strongly supported by the conversation, as \"sometimes\" suggests it is not a regular or an intense activity. 2. **Baseball**: The man says, \"Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now,\" when asked about sports. This indicates that he used to play baseball, but he doesn\u2019t play it regularly now. Thus, \"He plays baseball regularly now\" is incorrect. 3. **Exercise**: The man says, \"I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment\u2014sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time,\" which implies that he does have a regular form of exercise, specifically walking. While he also mentions that he never goes to the gym, his walking routine does indicate regular exercise. Based on this analysis, the best supported option is: C. He exercises regularly. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Is that Ann? W: Yes. M: This is Mike. How are things with you? W: Oh, very well, but I'm very busy. M: Busy? But you've finished all your exams? W: Yes, but I have to help my little sister with her foreign language. M: How about coming out with me this evening? There's a new film on. W: I'm afraid I can't. A friend of mine is coming from the south and I have to go to the station to meet him. M: What a pity! How about the weekend then? W: No, I've arranged to go to an art exhibition with my parents. M: What about next week sometime? W: Maybe.             question:             What is the woman going to do tonight?             options:             A. Go to an exhibition with her parents. B. Meet her friend at the station. C. Help her sister with English.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what the woman is going to do tonight, let's break down the dialogue: 1. **Initial Conversation**: Mike and the woman (Ann) exchange greetings. Ann mentions she is very busy, even though she has finished her exams. 2. **Reason for Being Busy**: Ann explains she has to help her little sister with a foreign language. 3. **Inviting Out for the Evening**: Mike invites Ann to go out with him that evening to see a new film. However, Ann declines the invitation. 4. **Reason for Decline**: Ann says she can't go because a friend of hers is coming from the south, and she has to go to the station to meet him. From these points, we can see that Ann's plan for the evening is to meet her friend at the station. Therefore, the correct answer is: B. Meet her friend at the station. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is B.\n\nQ: dialogue:             W: Hello, Pasadena Inn. How may I direct your call?

B. He wants to build a penthouse. C. He wants to get some books.\nA: Let's think step by step. The dialogue involves a man, referred to as M, who is calling the Pasadena Inn.

During the conversation, M also specifies that he wants to make reservations for the penthouse. This further reinforces that his call is about securing a reservation, specifically for a certain type of accommodation at the inn. The options presented in the question are: A. He wants to make a reservation. B. He wants to build a penthouse. C. He wants to get some books. Given the information and the context of the dialogue, the correct choice is: A.

Where are you heading with that big bag? W: I'm offto the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know. M: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? W: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. M: I see. W: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? M: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. W: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? M: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV W: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. M: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. W: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime?

B. He plays baseball regularly now. C. He exercises regularly.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what we know about the man based on the dialogue, let's analyze the relevant parts of their conversation: 1. **Cycling**: The man mentions, \"I go cycling sometimes too\", which indicates that he does enjoy cycling occasionally but doesn't suggest that he does it very frequently or passionately. Thus, the option \"He likes cycling very much\" may not be strongly supported by the conversation, as \"sometimes\" suggests it is not a regular or an intense activity. 2. **Baseball**: The man says, \"Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now,\" when asked about sports. This indicates that he used to play baseball, but he doesn\u2019t play it regularly now. Thus, \"He plays baseball regularly now\" is incorrect. 3. **Exercise**: The man says, \"I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment\u2014sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time,\" which implies that he does have a regular form of exercise, specifically walking. While he also mentions that he never goes to the gym, his walking routine does indicate regular exercise. Based on this analysis, the best supported option is: C. He exercises regularly. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Is that Ann? W: Yes. M: This is Mike. How are things with you?

Mom, Dad's being mean to me. Father: Okay, let me get my reading glasses here. Okay, here we are. Rule number one: No driving with friends for the first six months. Daughter: What? Father: Teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight. Daughter: But that's not me! Do I really need this lecture? This is such a drag! Father: Furthermore, who really needs a car when a pair of shoes will work? I mean, life was different when I was your age. In fact, I used to walk to school ... Daughter: Yeah, yeah. I know. Both ways uphill in ten feet of snow. I've heard this story many times.

Daughter: But the movie theater is right across the street from our house. Father: Exactly, so you can just park in the driveway and walk there. Daughter: Mom! Dad's being unreasonable. Father: And rule number four: You should never use a cell phone while driving. That could cause an accident. Daughter: But YOU do. Father: That's different. Daughter: How's it different? You even need my help to turn your cell phone on. Father: And rule number five: Remember that I love you, and I'm just a protective father who wants his daughter to always be safe. Daughter: Does that mean I can take the car now? Father: Well, I don't know. Daughter: Please dad, please. You're the best dad in the whole wide world. Father: That's not what you said earlier.

The daughter\u2019s reply to the father, \"Nothing. I got my driver's license,\" confirms that the exciting news is about her obtaining her driver\u2019s license. 4. **Explanation**: The daughter's excitement comes from having received her driver's license.

He mentions that supermarkets outside the city are cheaper and offers to pick up anything she needs. 2. **The woman's response**: The woman expresses her reluctance to let anyone else drive her car (\"I don't like to let anyone else drive my car\"). 3. **Her solution**: She suggests an alternative by saying, \"Tell you what, why don't we go together?\" Based on her response, the woman is not willing to lend her car, but she offers to go to the supermarket with the man instead. She implies that she will drive instead of allowing him to use her car by suggesting they go together. Now, let's analyze the options: A. The man should buy a car of his own. - This option is not supported by the dialogue. The woman doesn't suggest or imply that the man needs to get his own car. B.

M responds that it is impossible because Mike left for London the day before yesterday and hasn't returned. Given this exchange: - W mentions \"Mike,\" which is a person's name. - M also refers to \"he,\" reinforcing that they are talking about a person. The focus of their conversation is on \"Mike\" and his whereabouts. Neither a building nor a book is mentioned or implied in the dialogue. Therefore, they are most likely talking about: A.

Daughter: Nothing. I got my driver's license. Okay. Bye. Father: Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? Daughter: Mom said I could take the car to school this morning, and ... Father: Hold on here. I've prepared a few rules regarding the use of the motor vehicles in this house. Daughter: Like what? Father: Let me get my notes here. Daughter: Dad! That looks like a book? Mom, Dad's being mean to me. Father: Okay, let me get my reading glasses here. Okay, here we are. Rule number one: No driving with friends for the first six months. Daughter: What? Father: Teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight. Daughter: But that's not me! Do I really need this lecture? This is such a drag! Father: Furthermore, who really needs a car when a pair of shoes will work? I mean, life was different when I was your age. In fact, I used to walk to school ... Daughter: Yeah, yeah. I know. Both ways uphill in ten feet of snow. I've heard this story many times. Father: Yeah. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Rule number two: You always must wear your seat belt and obey the rules of the road. Daughter: Duh. I wasn't born yesterday. Father: Okay, rule number three: You can't drive long distances at night because you might get drowsy and drive off the road. But driving to the movie theater is fine. Daughter: But the movie theater is right across the street from our house. Father: Exactly, so you can just park in the driveway and walk there. Daughter: Mom! Dad's being unreasonable. Father: And rule number four: You should never use a cell phone while driving. That could cause an accident. Daughter: But YOU do. Father: That's different. Daughter: How's it different? You even need my help to turn your cell phone on. Father: And rule number five: Remember that I love you, and I'm just a protective father who wants his daughter to always be safe. Daughter: Does that mean I can take the car now? Father: Well, I don't know. Daughter: Please dad, please. You're the best dad in the whole wide world. Father: That's not what you said earlier.

I got it.\" This indicates that she has recently acquired something significant. 2. **Mother\u2019s Response**: The mother's response, \"Great.

The daughter\u2019s reply to the father, \"Nothing. I got my driver's license,\" confirms that the exciting news is about her obtaining her driver\u2019s license. 4. **Explanation**: The daughter's excitement comes from having received her driver's license. She expresses a desire to drive when she mentions she could take the car to school, indicating an eagerness to use her newly acquired license. 5. **Reviewing Options**: - **Option A**: States she has just started driver's education classes at school. There is no mention of starting classes, and since she already has her license, this option does not apply. - **Option B**: Suggest \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Hi, Laura. Where are you heading with that big bag? W: I'm offto the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know. M: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? W: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. M: I see. W: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? M: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. W: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? M: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV W: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. M: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. W: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime? M: Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that.             question:             What do you know about the man?             options:             A. He likes cycling very much. B. He plays baseball regularly now. C. He exercises regularly.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what we know about the man based on the dialogue, let's analyze the relevant parts of their conversation: 1. **Cycling**: The man mentions, \"I go cycling sometimes too\", which indicates that he does enjoy cycling occasionally but doesn't suggest that he does it very frequently or passionately. Thus, the option \"He likes cycling very much\" may not be strongly supported by the conversation, as \"sometimes\" suggests it is not a regular or an intense activity. 2. **Baseball**: The man says, \"Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now,\" when asked about sports. This indicates that he used to play baseball, but he doesn\u2019t play it regularly now. Thus, \"He plays baseball regularly now\" is incorrect. 3. **Exercise**: The man says, \"I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment\u2014sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time,\" which implies that he does have a regular form of exercise, specifically walking. While he also mentions that he never goes to the gym, his walking routine does indicate regular exercise. Based on this analysis, the best supported option is: C. He exercises regularly. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Is that Ann? W: Yes. M: This is Mike. How are things with you? W: Oh, very well, but I'm very busy. M: Busy? But you've finished all your exams? W: Yes, but I have to help my little sister with her foreign language. M: How about coming out with me this evening? There's a new film on. W: I'm afraid I can't. A friend of mine is coming from the south and I have to go to the station to meet him. M: What a pity! How about the weekend then? W: No, I've arranged to go to an art exhibition with my parents. M: What about next week sometime? W: Maybe.             question:             What is the woman going to do tonight?             options:             A. Go to an exhibition with her parents. B. Meet her friend at the station. C. Help her sister with English.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what the woman is going to do tonight, let's break down the dialogue: 1. **Initial Conversation**: Mike and the woman (Ann) exchange greetings. Ann mentions she is very busy, even though she has finished her exams. 2. **Reason for Being Busy**: Ann explains she has to help her little sister with a foreign language. 3. **Inviting Out for the Evening**: Mike invites Ann to go out with him that evening to see a new film. However, Ann declines the invitation. 4. **Reason for Decline**: Ann says she can't go because a friend of hers is coming from the south, and she has to go to the station to meet him. From these points, we can see that Ann's plan for the evening is to meet her friend at the station. Therefore, the correct answer is: B. Meet her friend at the station. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is B.\n\nQ: dialogue:             W: Hello, Pasadena Inn. How may I direct your call?

I'll have Tony call you first thing tomorrow morning.             question:             What does the man make the phone call for?             options:             A. He wants to make a reservation. B. He wants to build a penthouse. C. He wants to get some books.\nA: Let's think step by step. The dialogue involves a man, referred to as M, who is calling the Pasadena Inn.

During the conversation, M also specifies that he wants to make reservations for the penthouse. This further reinforces that his call is about securing a reservation, specifically for a certain type of accommodation at the inn. The options presented in the question are: A. He wants to make a reservation. B. He wants to build a penthouse. C. He wants to get some books. Given the information and the context of the dialogue, the correct choice is: A. He wants to make a reservation. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is A.\n\nQ: dialogue:             Woman: So, what is your schedule like every day?

I got it.\" This indicates that she has recently acquired something significant. 2. **Mother\u2019s Response**: The mother's response, \"Great.

The daughter\u2019s reply to the father, \"Nothing.

Where are you heading with that big bag? W: I'm offto the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know. M: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? W: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. M: I see. W: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? M: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. W: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? M: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV W: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. M: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. W: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime?

Thus, the option \"He likes cycling very much\" may not be strongly supported by the conversation, as \"sometimes\" suggests it is not a regular or an intense activity. 2. **Baseball**: The man says, \"Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now,\" when asked about sports. This indicates that he used to play baseball, but he doesn\u2019t play it regularly now. Thus, \"He plays baseball regularly now\" is incorrect. 3. **Exercise**: The man says, \"I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment\u2014sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time,\" which implies that he does have a regular form of exercise, specifically walking. While he also mentions that he never goes to the gym, his walking routine does indicate regular exercise. Based on this analysis, the best supported option is: C. He exercises regularly. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Is that Ann? W: Yes. M: This is Mike. How are things with you?

W: No, I've arranged to go to an art exhibition with my parents. M: What about next week sometime? W: Maybe.             question:             What is the woman going to do tonight?             options:             A. Go to an exhibition with her parents. B. Meet her friend at the station. C.

However, Ann declines the invitation. 4. **Reason for Decline**: Ann says she can't go because a friend of hers is coming from the south, and she has to go to the station to meet him.

This demonstrates her determination to take the course despite potential challenges.\n3. **Reason for Interest**: She explains her strong interest in the geology of the American West and mentions that previous coursework was not challenging enough for her, suggesting she is seeking a more advanced and rigorous learning experience.\n4. **Professor's Consideration**: The professor expresses concern that the course might be challenging for juniors but is willing to consider her request after consulting with Professor Burman, who presumably has already taught her.\nGiven this analysis, the woman's main reason for talking to the professor is to seek permission to enroll in the Advanced Geology course. She does not mention needing recommended books or applying to graduate study at this time.\nTherefore, the correct option is: B. She wants to take an advanced course.", "pred_ans": "B", "wrap_que": "Q: dialogue:             M: Do you think I could borrow your car to go grocery shopping?

The man needn't go shopping every week. C. She will drive the man to the supermarket.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what the woman means, let's analyze the dialogue step by step: 1. **The man's request**: The man asks if he can borrow the woman's car to go grocery shopping. He mentions that supermarkets outside the city are cheaper and offers to pick up anything she needs. 2. **The woman's response**: The woman expresses her reluctance to let anyone else drive her car (\"I don't like to let anyone else drive my car\"). 3. **Her solution**: She suggests an alternative by saying, \"Tell you what, why don't we go together?\" Based on her response, the woman is not willing to lend her car, but she offers to go to the supermarket with the man instead. She implies that she will drive instead of allowing him to use her car by suggesting they go together. Now, let's analyze the options: A. The man should buy a car of his own. - This option is not supported by the dialogue. The woman doesn't suggest or imply that the man needs to get his own car. B. The man needn't go shopping every week. - This option is also not relevant to the conversation. The woman's response doesn't address the frequency of shopping trips. C. She will drive the man to the supermarket. - \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             W: Yesterday I met Mike in the street. M: It's impossible.

A building C. A book\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what W and M are talking about, let's analyze the dialogue: 1. W says they met \"Mike\" in the street. 2. M responds that it is impossible because Mike left for London the day before yesterday and hasn't returned. Given this exchange: - W mentions \"Mike,\" which is a person's name. - M also refers to \"he,\" reinforcing that they are talking about a person. The focus of their conversation is on \"Mike\" and his whereabouts. Neither a building nor a book is mentioned or implied in the dialogue. Therefore, they are most likely talking about: A.

Daughter: Nothing. I got my driver's license. Okay. Bye. Father: Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? Daughter: Mom said I could take the car to school this morning, and ... Father: Hold on here. I've prepared a few rules regarding the use of the motor vehicles in this house. Daughter: Like what? Father: Let me get my notes here. Daughter: Dad! That looks like a book? Mom, Dad's being mean to me. Father: Okay, let me get my reading glasses here. Okay, here we are. Rule number one: No driving with friends for the first six months. Daughter: What? Father: Teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight. Daughter: But that's not me! Do I really need this lecture? This is such a drag! Father: Furthermore, who really needs a car when a pair of shoes will work? I mean, life was different when I was your age. In fact, I used to walk to school ... Daughter: Yeah, yeah. I know. Both ways uphill in ten feet of snow. I've heard this story many times. Father: Yeah. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Rule number two: You always must wear your seat belt and obey the rules of the road. Daughter: Duh. I wasn't born yesterday. Father: Okay, rule number three: You can't drive long distances at night because you might get drowsy and drive off the road. But driving to the movie theater is fine. Daughter: But the movie theater is right across the street from our house. Father: Exactly, so you can just park in the driveway and walk there. Daughter: Mom! Dad's being unreasonable. Father: And rule number four: You should never use a cell phone while driving. That could cause an accident. Daughter: But YOU do. Father: That's different. Daughter: How's it different? You even need my help to turn your cell phone on. Father: And rule number five: Remember that I love you, and I'm just a protective father who wants his daughter to always be safe. Daughter: Does that mean I can take the car now? Father: Well, I don't know. Daughter: Please dad, please. You're the best dad in the whole wide world. Father: That's not what you said earlier. Daughter: Hey, having the car keys in my hands changes my whole perspective on life. Father: Well, okay. I guess if I'm considered the best dad in the world for five minutes, then I'll accept that.

She has just started driver's education classes at school. B. She is taking her driver's license road test today. C. She has her license and wants to drive now.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the girl is excited at the beginning of the conversation, we can analyze the dialogue step by step: 1. **Daughter's Statement**: The daughter says, \"Guess what, Mom. I got it.\" This indicates that she has recently acquired something significant. 2. **Mother\u2019s Response**: The mother's response, \"Great. That's super,\" suggests that whatever the daughter \"got\" is a positive accomplishment or event. 3. **Father\u2019s Question**: The father\u2019s question, \"So, what did you get me?\" shows he is unaware of what the daughter is talking about. The daughter\u2019s reply to the father, \"Nothing. I got my driver's license,\" confirms that the exciting news is about her obtaining her driver\u2019s license. 4. **Explanation**: The daughter's excitement comes from having received her driver's license. She expresses a desire to drive when she mentions she could take the car to school, indicating an eagerness to use her newly acquired license. 5. **Reviewing Options**: - **Option A**: States she has just started driver's education classes at school. There is no mention of starting classes, and since she already has her license, this option does not apply. - **Option B**: Suggest \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Hi, Laura. Where are you heading with that big bag? W: I'm offto the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know. M: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? W: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. M: I see. W: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? M: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. W: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? M: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV W: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. M: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. W: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime? M: Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that.             question:             What do you know about the man?             options:             A. He likes cycling very much. B. He plays baseball regularly now. C. He exercises regularly.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what we know about the man based on the dialogue, let's analyze the relevant parts of their conversation: 1. **Cycling**: The man mentions, \"I go cycling sometimes too\", which indicates that he does enjoy cycling occasionally but doesn't suggest that he does it very frequently or passionately. Thus, the option \"He likes cycling very much\" may not be strongly supported by the conversation, as \"sometimes\" suggests it is not a regular or an intense activity. 2. **Baseball**: The man says, \"Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now,\" when asked about sports. This indicates that he used to play baseball, but he doesn\u2019t play it regularly now. Thus, \"He plays baseball regularly now\" is incorrect. 3. **Exercise**: The man says, \"I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment\u2014sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time,\" which implies that he does have a regular form of exercise, specifically walking. While he also mentions that he never goes to the gym, his walking routine does indicate regular exercise. Based on this analysis, the best supported option is: C. He exercises regularly. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Is that Ann? W: Yes. M: This is Mike. How are things with you?

There's a new film on. W: I'm afraid I can't. A friend of mine is coming from the south and I have to go to the station to meet him. M: What a pity! How about the weekend then? W: No, I've arranged to go to an art exhibition with my parents. M: What about next week sometime? W: Maybe.             question:             What is the woman going to do tonight?             options:             A. Go to an exhibition with her parents. B. Meet her friend at the station. C. Help her sister with English.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what the woman is going to do tonight, let's break down the dialogue: 1. **Initial Conversation**: Mike and the woman (Ann) exchange greetings. Ann mentions she is very busy, even though she has finished her exams. 2. **Reason for Being Busy**: Ann explains she has to help her little sister with a foreign language. 3. **Inviting Out for the Evening**: Mike invites Ann to go out with him that evening to see a new film. However, Ann declines the invitation. 4. **Reason for Decline**: Ann says she can't go because a friend of hers is coming from the south, and she has to go to the station to meet him. From these points, we can see that Ann's plan for the evening is to meet her friend at the station. Therefore, the correct answer is: B. Meet her friend at the station. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is B.\n\nQ: dialogue:             W: Hello, Pasadena Inn. How may I direct your call?

I'd also be happy to pick up anything you need. W: Well, I don't like to let anyone else drive my car. Tell you what, why don't we go together?             question:             What does the woman mean?             options:             A. The man should buy a car of his own. B. The man needn't go shopping every week. C. She will drive the man to the supermarket.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what the woman means, let's analyze the dialogue step by step: 1. **The man's request**: The man asks if he can borrow the woman's car to go grocery shopping. He mentions that supermarkets outside the city are cheaper and offers to pick up anything she needs. 2. **The woman's response**: The woman expresses her reluctance to let anyone else drive her car (\"I don't like to let anyone else drive my car\"). 3. **Her solution**: She suggests an alternative by saying, \"Tell you what, why don't we go together?\" Based on her response, the woman is not willing to lend her car, but she offers to go to the supermarket with the man instead. She implies that she will drive instead of allowing him to use her car by suggesting they go together. Now, let's analyze the options: A. The man should buy a car of his own. - This option is not supported by the dialogue. The woman doesn't suggest or imply that the man needs to get his own car. B. The man needn't go shopping every week. - This option is also not relevant to the conversation. The woman's response doesn't address the frequency of shopping trips. C. She will drive the man to the supermarket. - \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             W: Yesterday I met Mike in the street. M: It's impossible. He left for London the day before yesterday and hasn't come back yet.             question:             What are they probably talking about?             options:             A. A man B. A building C. A book\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what W and M are talking about, let's analyze the dialogue: 1. W says they met \"Mike\" in the street. 2. M responds that it is impossible because Mike left for London the day before yesterday and hasn't returned. Given this exchange: - W mentions \"Mike,\" which is a person's name. - M also refers to \"he,\" reinforcing that they are talking about a person. The focus of their conversation is on \"Mike\" and his whereabouts. Neither a building nor a book is mentioned or implied in the dialogue. Therefore, they are most likely talking about: A. A man \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is A.\n\nQ: dialogue:             Daughter: Guess what, Mom. I got it. Mother: Great. That's super. Father: What's going on? So, what did you get me? Daughter: Nothing. I got my driver's license. Okay. Bye. Father: Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? Daughter: Mom said I could take the car to school this morning, and ... Father: Hold on here. I've prepared a few rules regarding the use of the motor vehicles in this house. Daughter: Like what? Father: Let me get my notes here. Daughter: Dad! That looks like a book? Mom, Dad's being mean to me. Father: Okay, let me get my reading glasses here. Okay, here we are. Rule number one: No driving with friends for the first six months. Daughter: What? Father: Teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight. Daughter: But that's not me! Do I really need this lecture? This is such a drag! Father: Furthermore, who really needs a car when a pair of shoes will work? I mean, life was different when I was your age. In fact, I used to walk to school ... Daughter: Yeah, yeah. I know. Both ways uphill in ten feet of snow. I've heard this story many times. Father: Yeah. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Rule number two: You always must wear your seat belt and obey the rules of the road. Daughter: Duh. I wasn't born yesterday. Father: Okay, rule number three: You can't drive long distances at night because you might get drowsy and drive off the road. But driving to the movie theater is fine. Daughter: But the movie theater is right across the street from our house. Father: Exactly, so you can just park in the driveway and walk there. Daughter: Mom! Dad's being unreasonable. Father: And rule number four: You should never use a cell phone while driving. That could cause an accident. Daughter: But YOU do. Father: That's different. Daughter: How's it different? You even need my help to turn your cell phone on. Father: And rule number five: Remember that I love you, and I'm just a protective father who wants his daughter to always be safe. Daughter: Does that mean I can take the car now? Father: Well, I don't know. Daughter: Please dad, please. You're the best dad in the whole wide world. Father: That's not what you said earlier. Daughter: Hey, having the car keys in my hands changes my whole perspective on life. Father: Well, okay. I guess if I'm considered the best dad in the world for five minutes, then I'll accept that. Daughter: Yeah. Father: Okay, but drive carefully and don't forget to fill up the car with gas before you come home. [Bye. Love ya guys.] Okay. Hon, do you think I did the right thing? Mother: Yeah. She has to grow up sometime.             question:             Why is the girl excited at the beginning of the conversation?             options:             A. She has just started driver's education classes at school. B. She is taking her driver's license road test today. C. She has her license and wants to drive now.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the girl is excited at the beginning of the conversation, we can analyze the dialogue step by step: 1. **Daughter's Statement**: The daughter says, \"Guess what, Mom. I got it.\" This indicates that she has recently acquired something significant. 2. **Mother\u2019s Response**: The mother's response, \"Great. That's super,\" suggests that whatever the daughter \"got\" is a positive accomplishment or event. 3. **Father\u2019s Question**: The father\u2019s question, \"So, what did you get me?\" shows he is unaware of what the daughter is talking about. The daughter\u2019s reply to the father, \"Nothing. I got my driver's license,\" confirms that the exciting news is about her obtaining her driver\u2019s license. 4. **Explanation**: The daughter's excitement comes from having received her driver's license. She expresses a desire to drive when she mentions she could take the car to school, indicating an eagerness to use her newly acquired license. 5. **Reviewing Options**: - **Option A**: States she has just started driver's education classes at school. There is no mention of starting classes, and since she already has her license, this option does not apply. - **Option B**: Suggest \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Hi, Laura. Where are you heading with that big bag? W: I'm offto the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know. M: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? W: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. M: I see. W: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? M: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. W: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? M: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV W: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. M: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. W: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime? M: Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that.             question:             What do you know about the man?             options:             A. He likes cycling very much. B. He plays baseball regularly now. C. He exercises regularly.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what we know about the man based on the dialogue, let's analyze the relevant parts of their conversation: 1. **Cycling**: The man mentions, \"I go cycling sometimes too\", which indicates that he does enjoy cycling occasionally but doesn't suggest that he does it very frequently or passionately. Thus, the option \"He likes cycling very much\" may not be strongly supported by the conversation, as \"sometimes\" suggests it is not a regular or an intense activity. 2. **Baseball**: The man says, \"Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now,\" when asked about sports. This indicates that he used to play baseball, but he doesn\u2019t play it regularly now. Thus, \"He plays baseball regularly now\" is incorrect. 3. **Exercise**: The man says, \"I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment\u2014sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time,\" which implies that he does have a regular form of exercise, specifically walking. While he also mentions that he never goes to the gym, his walking routine does indicate regular exercise. Based on this analysis, the best supported option is: C. He exercises regularly. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is C.\n\nQ: dialogue:             M: Is that Ann? W: Yes. M: This is Mike. How are things with you?

There's a new film on. W: I'm afraid I can't. A friend of mine is coming from the south and I have to go to the station to meet him. M: What a pity! How about the weekend then? W: No, I've arranged to go to an art exhibition with my parents. M: What about next week sometime? W: Maybe.             question:             What is the woman going to do tonight?             options:             A. Go to an exhibition with her parents. B. Meet her friend at the station. C. Help her sister with English.\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine what the woman is going to do tonight, let's break down the dialogue: 1. **Initial Conversation**: Mike and the woman (Ann) exchange greetings. Ann mentions she is very busy, even though she has finished her exams. 2. **Reason for Being Busy**: Ann explains she has to help her little sister with a foreign language. 3. **Inviting Out for the Evening**: Mike invites Ann to go out with him that evening to see a new film. However, Ann declines the invitation. 4. **Reason for Decline**: Ann says she can't go because a friend of hers is coming from the south, and she has to go to the station to meet him. From these points, we can see that Ann's plan for the evening is to meet her friend at the station. Therefore, the correct answer is: B. Meet her friend at the station. \nTherefore, among A through C, the answer is B.\n\nQ: dialogue:             W: Hello, Pasadena Inn. How may I direct your call?
