{"question": "Q: article:\n            As digital technology increasingly controls the lives of young people, scientists have begun to wonder: Is the Internet good or bad for kids?\n\"It's impossible to answer that question because the Internet is so many things,\" says psychologist Patricia Greenfield. \"It's networked computer games and news about politics and instant messaging and e-mails to your grandmother. It can be both an educational resource and a hiding place for kidnappers.\"\nAdults have many reasons to worry about kids' Internet use. In chat rooms, for instance, it is easy to lie and kids can get trapped in dangerous situations. In searching for and visiting websites, kids can come across words and pictures that they may not be prepared for. To help prevent that situation, in 2000, the US Congress passed the Children's Internet Protection Act, which requires schools to block offensive and obscene websites.\nResearches have pointed out how confusing the Internet can be for children, even when they think they know how it works. To find out how much kids know about the technology, Zheng Yan, an educational professor in New York, interviews over 300 students in grades four to eight. Most of the youngest students think the Internet is simply an icon   on the screen. It often isn't until 10 that kids realize that the Internet is a network of millions of computers. It takes another 2 or 3 years for them to understand that a stranger can see what they've posted.\nUnderstanding the technology helps kids understand how dangerous the web can be. It's not simply enough to block harmful websites or to limit the number of hours kids spend online. Learning about the Internet can also give young people the power to use it in beneficial ways.\n            question:\n            According to the Children's Internet Protection Act passed in 2000,   _  .\n            options:\n            A. children are not allowed to go online at schools B. schools must watch students' behavior all the time C. children must be prevented from having access to unhealthy websites D. it is against the law to search for unhealthy information online\n         A: ", "rationale": "To determine the correct answer, we need to refer to the information provided in the article regarding the Children's Internet Protection Act passed in 2000:\n1. The article mentions that the Act requires schools to block offensive and obscene websites. This indicates that the focus of the Act is on preventing children from accessing harmful or inappropriate online content while they are at school.\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n- **Option A: children are not allowed to go online at schools**: This is not accurate according to the article. The Act doesn't prevent children from going online; instead, it requires blocking specific types of content.\n- **Option B: schools must watch students' behavior all the time**: The article does not mention continuous monitoring of students' behavior as a requirement of the Act.\n- **Option C: children must be prevented from having access to unhealthy websites**: This option aligns with the article, as the Act requires schools to block offensive and obscene websites, effectively preventing access to unhealthy websites.\n- **Option D: it is against the law to search for unhealthy information online**: This is not supported by the article, which focuses on blocking access at schools rather than making it illegal to search for such information in general.\nTherefore, the correct option is C: children must be prevented from having access to unhealthy websites.", "pred_ans": "C", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

Sibshops (Ages 10-13)', 'D. Banana Splits']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine which program you can attend on a Saturday, we need to look at the schedules provided for each program in the article. 1. **Friends and Buddies**: This program is held on 2 Fridays per month. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 2. **Club Saturday Swim**: This program is held each Saturday afternoon from 12:00-12:30 pm or 12:30-1:00 pm. This means it is available on Saturdays. 3. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13)**: This program is held on Wednesdays from 4:00-5:00 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:\n            As digital technology increasingly controls the lives of young people, scientists have begun to wonder: Is the Internet good or bad for kids?\n\"It's impossible to answer that question because the Internet is so many things,\" says psychologist Patricia Greenfield. \"It's networked computer games and news about politics and instant messaging and e-mails to your grandmother.

{"question": "Q: article:\n            Several times my daughter had telephoned to say, \"Mum, you must come and see the daffodils before they are over.\"\nI wanted to go, but it was a two-hour drive from Lake Arrowhead. \"I will go next Tuesday,\" I promised, a little unwillingly, on her third call.\nThe next Tuesday dawned cold and rainy. Still, I had promised, and so I drove there. When I finally walked\ninto Carolyn's house and hugged and greeted my grandchildren, I said, \"Forget the daffodils, Carolyn! Theroad is invisible   in the cloud and fog, and there is nothing in the world except you and thesechildren that I want to see!\"\nMy daughter smiled calmly and said, \"We drive in this weather all the time, Mum. You will never forgive\nyourself if you miss this experience.\"\nAfter about twenty minutes, we turned onto a small road and I saw a small church. On the far side of the church, I saw a hand-lettered sign that read \"Daffodil Garden\"?We got out of the car and each took a child's hand, and I followed Carolyn down the path.

The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:\n            Several times my daughter had telephoned to say, \"Mum, you must come and see the daffodils before they are over.\"\nI wanted to go, but it was a two-hour drive from Lake Arrowhead. \"I will go next Tuesday,\" I promised, a little unwillingly, on her third call.\nThe next Tuesday dawned cold and rainy. Still, I had promised, and so I drove there. When I finally walked\ninto Carolyn's house and hugged and greeted my grandchildren, I said, \"Forget the daffodils, Carolyn!

It describes how the advent of the Internet and 24-hour news was initially seen as a threat to printed newspapers, prompting many to create online versions. The main issue discussed is how newspapers adapted to this change and how they attempted to maintain their readership and generate revenue. Furthermore, it touches on how online readership differs from traditional print readership and how newspapers now offer more than just news, using online platforms for podcasts and videos.\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n- **A. What newspapers are mainly about.** This option does not encapsulate the primary focus of the passage, as it is not about the content of newspapers but rather their adaptation to technological changes.\n- **B. How the Internet affects newspapers.** This option accurately reflects the core discussion of the text, which is about the influence of the Internet on newspapers and how they have had to adapt.\n- **C.

The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

To determine which program you can attend on a Saturday, we need to look at the schedules provided for each program in the article. 1. **Friends and Buddies**: This program is held on 2 Fridays per month. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 2. **Club Saturday Swim**: This program is held each Saturday afternoon from 12:00-12:30 pm or 12:30-1:00 pm. This means it is available on Saturdays. 3. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13)**: This program is held on Wednesdays from 4:00-5:00 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:\n            What did the arrival of the Internet and 24 hours news mean for British newspapers?\nAt first, this looked like the end of printed newspapers.

The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

To determine which program you can attend on a Saturday, we need to look at the schedules provided for each program in the article. 1. **Friends and Buddies**: This program is held on 2 Fridays per month. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 2. **Club Saturday Swim**: This program is held each Saturday afternoon from 12:00-12:30 pm or 12:30-1:00 pm. This means it is available on Saturdays. 3. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13)**: This program is held on Wednesdays from 4:00-5:00 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:\n            Traveling can be a way to gain life experiences,especially during Spring Break--a week long school vacation in the United States.

{"question": "Q: article:\n            A new study found that inner-city kids living in neighborhoods with more green space gained about 13% less weight over a two-year period than kids living among more concrete and fewer trees. Such findings tell a powerful story. The obesity epidemic began in the 1980s, and many people think it results from increased portion  sizes and inactivity , but that can't be everything. Big Macs and TVs have been with us for a long time. \"Most experts agree that the changes were related to something in the environment,\" says Thomas Glass of the Hopkins School of Public Health. That something could be a shrinking of the green.\nThe new research, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, isn't the first to associate greenery with better health, but it does get us closer to identifying what works and why. At its most straightforward, a green neighborhood simply means more places for kids to play -- which is important since time spent outdoors is one of the strongest links to children's activity levels.\nGlass warns that most studies don't necessarily prove a link between greenness and health, but they're helping _ action. In September the U.S. government approved the No Child Left Inside Act to encourage public initiatives  aimed at exposing kids to the outdoors.\nFinding green space is, of course, not always easy, and you may have to work a bit to get your family a little grass and trees.

The study discussed in the passage found that children living in neighborhoods with more green space gained less weight than those in more concrete-heavy areas. This highlights the potential impact of the environment, specifically greenery, on obesity rates among children.\n2. The passage mentions the obesity epidemic and suggests that it might not be explained solely by factors such as portion sizes and inactivity, suggesting that environmental changes, like the lack of green space, could be significant contributors.\n3. The passage notes that the association between green spaces and better health isn't definitively proven, but points to public initiatives like the No Child Left Inside Act, which aim to increase exposure to outdoor environments.\n4. The passage offers practical advice, encouraging people to seek out and utilize green spaces for their children's benefit.\nGiven these points, the best title should reflect the idea that green spaces can contribute to reducing obesity rates.

The obesity epidemic**: While obesity is a topic in the passage, the focus is specifically on how green spaces relate to obesity, making this option too broad.\n- **B. Slimmer in the grass**: This title captures the main idea of the study and the suggested relationship between living in greener areas and less weight gain.\n- **C. Causes of obesity**: The passage doesn't list all possible causes of obesity, only discussing the potential impact of lack of greenery.\n- **D. Prevention of obesity**: While the passage touches on prevention through greenery, this title lacks the specific focus on the environmental aspect that is central to the passage.\nTherefore, the best title, which encapsulates the main theme, is **B. Slimmer in the grass**.", "pred_ans": "B", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

Sibshops (Ages 10-13)', 'D. Banana Splits']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine which program you can attend on a Saturday, we need to look at the schedules provided for each program in the article. 1. **Friends and Buddies**: This program is held on 2 Fridays per month. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 2. **Club Saturday Swim**: This program is held each Saturday afternoon from 12:00-12:30 pm or 12:30-1:00 pm. This means it is available on Saturdays. 3. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13)**: This program is held on Wednesdays from 4:00-5:00 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:\n            A new study found that inner-city kids living in neighborhoods with more green space gained about 13% less weight over a two-year period than kids living among more concrete and fewer trees. Such findings tell a powerful story. The obesity epidemic began in the 1980s, and many people think it results from increased portion  sizes and inactivity , but that can't be everything. Big Macs and TVs have been with us for a long time. \"Most experts agree that the changes were related to something in the environment,\" says Thomas Glass of the Hopkins School of Public Health. That something could be a shrinking of the green.\nThe new research, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, isn't the first to associate greenery with better health, but it does get us closer to identifying what works and why. At its most straightforward, a green neighborhood simply means more places for kids to play -- which is important since time spent outdoors is one of the strongest links to children's activity levels.\nGlass warns that most studies don't necessarily prove a link between greenness and health, but they're helping _ action. In September the U.S. government approved the No Child Left Inside Act to encourage public initiatives  aimed at exposing kids to the outdoors.\nFinding green space is, of course, not always easy, and you may have to work a bit to get your family a little grass and trees. If you live in a suburb or a city with good parks, take advantage of what's there. Your children in particular will love it -- and their bodies will thank you.\n            question:\n            What might be the best title of the passage?\n            options:\n            A.

{"question": "Q: article:\n            1970 was \"World Conservation Year\". The United Nations wanted everyone to know that the world was in danger. They hoped that the governments would act quickly in order to conserve nature. Here is one example of the problem. At one time there were 1300 different plants, trees and flowers in Holland, but now only 860 remain. The others have been destroyed by modern man and his technology. We are changing the earth, the air and the water, and everything that grows and lives. We can't live without these things. If we continue like this, we shall destroy ourselves.\nWhat will happen in the future? Perhaps it is more important to ask \"What must we do now?\" The people who will be living in the world of tomorrow are the young of today. A lot of them know that conservation is necessary. Many are hoping to save our world. They plant trees, build bridges across rivers in forests and so on. In a small town in the United States a large group of girls cleaned the banks of eleven kilometres of their river. Young people may hear about conservation through a record called \"No, One's Going to Change our World. \" It was made by Scatles, Cliff Richard and other singers. The money from it will help to conserve wild animals.\n            question:\n            There are few plants, trees and flowers in Holland now because   _  .\n            options:\n            A. there has been a lot of conservation in Holland B. Holland does not need so many plants, trees and flowers C. many plants, trees and flowers don't grow there any more D. some plants, trees and flowers are dangerous\n         A: ", "rationale": "To determine the correct reason for the decrease in the number of plants, trees, and flowers in Holland, let's analyze the information provided in the article. \nThe article points out that at one time there were 1300 different types of plants, trees, and flowers in Holland, but now only 860 remain. The primary reason mentioned for this reduction is that modern man and his technology have destroyed many of these plants. This indicates that human activity and technological advancement have negatively impacted the environment in Holland, leading to the destruction of natural flora.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- **A. There has been a lot of conservation in Holland**: This contradicts the article's message, as conservation would suggest an effort to protect and preserve plant life, not reduce it.\n- **B. Holland does not need so many plants, trees, and flowers**: This option does not align with the article's discussion about the importance and necessity of conserving nature. The article implies that a diverse range of flora is important for a balanced ecosystem.\n- **C. Many plants, trees, and flowers don't grow there any more**: This is true but doesn't provide the reason why. It simply restates the result of the destruction caused by technological advancement and human activity.\n- **D. Some plants, trees, and flowers are dangerous**: The article does not mention anything about plants, trees, or flowers being dangerous. This is not the reason provided for their reduction.\nGiven the explanation in the article, option **C** is the closest, but it lacks the reason. The text explicitly states that the reduction is due to destruction by modern man and technology. Thus, the implied reason that fits best is option C, but keeping in mind that it occurs due to human activity and technology destroying them.\nTherefore, among A through D, the best correct choice is C, considering the context given.", "pred_ans": "C", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

Sibshops (Ages 10-13)', 'D. Banana Splits']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine which program you can attend on a Saturday, we need to look at the schedules provided for each program in the article. 1. **Friends and Buddies**: This program is held on 2 Fridays per month. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 2. **Club Saturday Swim**: This program is held each Saturday afternoon from 12:00-12:30 pm or 12:30-1:00 pm. This means it is available on Saturdays. 3. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13)**: This program is held on Wednesdays from 4:00-5:00 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:\n            1970 was \"World Conservation Year\". The United Nations wanted everyone to know that the world was in danger. They hoped that the governments would act quickly in order to conserve nature. Here is one example of the problem. At one time there were 1300 different plants, trees and flowers in Holland, but now only 860 remain. The others have been destroyed by modern man and his technology. We are changing the earth, the air and the water, and everything that grows and lives. We can't live without these things. If we continue like this, we shall destroy ourselves.\nWhat will happen in the future? Perhaps it is more important to ask \"What must we do now?\" The people who will be living in the world of tomorrow are the young of today. A lot of them know that conservation is necessary. Many are hoping to save our world. They plant trees, build bridges across rivers in forests and so on. In a small town in the United States a large group of girls cleaned the banks of eleven kilometres of their river. Young people may hear about conservation through a record called \"No, One's Going to Change our World. \" It was made by Scatles, Cliff Richard and other singers. The money from it will help to conserve wild animals.\n            question:\n            There are few plants, trees and flowers in Holland now because   _  .\n            options:\n            A. there has been a lot of conservation in Holland B. Holland does not need so many plants, trees and flowers C. many plants, trees and flowers don't grow there any more D. some plants, trees and flowers are dangerous\n         A:  Let's think step by step."}
{"question": "Q: article:\n            I sat with my friend in a well-known coffee shop in a neighboring town of Venice. As we enjoyed our coffee, a man called the waiter and placed his order, \"Two cups of coffee, one on the wall.\" We got interested and observed that he was served with one cup of coffee but he paid for two. As soon as he left, the waiter attached a piece of paper to the wall saying \"A Cup of Coffee.\" Similar occasions took place twice while we were there. It seemed that this gesture was quite normal at this place. However, it was something unique and confusing for us.\nAfter a few days, when we again enjoyed coffee there, a man entered. The way this man was dressed did not match the standard or the atmosphere of this coffee shop. Poverty was evident from his looks. As he seated himself, he looked at the wall and said, \"One cup of coffee from the wall.\" The waiter served coffee to this man with respect and dignity. The man had his coffee and left without paying. We were amazed to watch all this when the waiter took off a piece of paper from the wall and threw it in the dustbin.\nNow it was no surprise for us; the matter was very clear. The great respect for the needy shown by people in this town moved us to tears.\nCoffee is not a necessity. However, the point is that when we take pleasure in any blessing, maybe we also need to think about those people who also appreciate that specific blessing but cannot afford.\nNote the waiter, who gets the communication going between the affording and the needy with a smile on his face. Think about the man in need: he enters the coffee shop without having to lower his self-dignity; he has a free cup of coffee without asking or knowing about who has given this cup of coffee to him; he only looked at the wall, placed an order for himself, enjoyed his coffee and left. Besides, we need to remember the role played by the wall that reflects the generosity and care of people in this town.\n            question:\n            What made the author interested as well as confused?\n            options:\n            A.

This immediately sparked their interest and curiosity, as it was out of the ordinary and something they hadn't encountered before.\n2. **The Waiter's Action**: After the customer left, the waiter attached a piece of paper to the wall that said, \"A Cup of Coffee.\" This further added to the mystery, as it was unclear why this gesture was made.\n3. **Continued Practice**: The same event happened with other customers while they were there, suggesting that this practice was a regular occurrence at the coffee shop. The repetition of this action contributed to both interest and confusion for the author and his friend, as they observed something that appeared to be a local custom.\n4. **Revelation of the Practice**: Later, the author and his friend understood the gesture when a man in need, who could not afford coffee, requested \"one cup of coffee from the wall\" and was served with respect. This clarified that the wall represented a prepaid coffee for those who couldn't afford it, but at first, the significance of the wall was not clear to them.\nGiven these observations, the initial confusion and interest arose because customers were paying for extra coffee that was not consumed immediately and instead placed \"on the wall.\" Therefore, the appropriate option is: \nD.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

Sibshops (Ages 10-13)', 'D. Banana Splits']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine which program you can attend on a Saturday, we need to look at the schedules provided for each program in the article. 1. **Friends and Buddies**: This program is held on 2 Fridays per month. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 2. **Club Saturday Swim**: This program is held each Saturday afternoon from 12:00-12:30 pm or 12:30-1:00 pm. This means it is available on Saturdays. 3. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13)**: This program is held on Wednesdays from 4:00-5:00 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:\n            I sat with my friend in a well-known coffee shop in a neighboring town of Venice. As we enjoyed our coffee, a man called the waiter and placed his order, \"Two cups of coffee, one on the wall.\" We got interested and observed that he was served with one cup of coffee but he paid for two. As soon as he left, the waiter attached a piece of paper to the wall saying \"A Cup of Coffee.\" Similar occasions took place twice while we were there. It seemed that this gesture was quite normal at this place. However, it was something unique and confusing for us.\nAfter a few days, when we again enjoyed coffee there, a man entered. The way this man was dressed did not match the standard or the atmosphere of this coffee shop. Poverty was evident from his looks. As he seated himself, he looked at the wall and said, \"One cup of coffee from the wall.\" The waiter served coffee to this man with respect and dignity. The man had his coffee and left without paying. We were amazed to watch all this when the waiter took off a piece of paper from the wall and threw it in the dustbin.\nNow it was no surprise for us; the matter was very clear. The great respect for the needy shown by people in this town moved us to tears.\nCoffee is not a necessity. However, the point is that when we take pleasure in any blessing, maybe we also need to think about those people who also appreciate that specific blessing but cannot afford.\nNote the waiter, who gets the communication going between the affording and the needy with a smile on his face. Think about the man in need: he enters the coffee shop without having to lower his self-dignity; he has a free cup of coffee without asking or knowing about who has given this cup of coffee to him; he only looked at the wall, placed an order for himself, enjoyed his coffee and left. Besides, we need to remember the role played by the wall that reflects the generosity and care of people in this town.\n            question:\n            What made the author interested as well as confused?\n            options:\n            A. The waiter's making normal gestures. B. Customers' buying coffee for the needy. C. The waiter's attaching coffee orders on the wall. D. Customers' paying for coffee and having it put on the wall.\n         A:  Let's think step by step."}
{"question": "Q: article:\n            Chinese are very generous when it comes to educating their children. Not caring about the money, parents often send their children to the best schools or even abroad to England, the United States or Australia. They also want their children to take extra-course activities where they will learn a musical instrument or ballet or other classes which will give them a head start in life. The Chinese believe that the more expensive an education is, the better it is. So the parents will spend an unreasonable amount of money on education. Even poor couples will buy a computer for their son or daughter.\nHowever, what most parents fail to see is that the best early education they can give their children is usually very cheap.\nParents can see that their children's skills vary, skilled in some areas while poor in others. What most parents fail to realize though, is that today's children lack   self-respect and self-confidence.\nThe problem is that parents are only educating their children on how to take multiple-choice tests and how to study well, but parents aren't teaching them the most important skills they need to be confident, happy and clever.\nParents can achieve this by teaching practical skills like cooking, sewing and doing housework.\nTeaching a child to cook will improve many of the skills that he will need later in life. Cooking demands patience and time. It's an enjoyable but difficult experiment. A good cook always tries to improve his cooking, so he will learn to work hard and gradually to finish his job successfully. His result, a well-cooked dinner, will give him much satisfaction and a lot of self-confidence.\nSome old machines , such as a broken radio or TV set that you give your children to play with will make him curious   and arouse his interest He will spend hours looking at them, trying to fix them; your child might become an engineer when he grows up. These activities aren't merely teaching a child to read a book, but rather to think, to use his mind. And that is more important.\n            question:\n            Generally speaking, children's skills  _  .\n            options:\n            A. come from their parents B. have nothing to do with their education C. may be different D. have something to do with their marks in the exams\n         A: ", "rationale": "To determine the general statement about children's skills according to the passage, let's analyze the section that discusses skills:\n1. **Parents' Awareness of Skills**: The passage notes that \"Parents can see that their children's skills vary, skilled in some areas while poor in others.\" This implies that children's skills can differ from one another, recognizing diversity in skill sets.\n2. **Education and Skills**: The passage emphasizes that the best early education is practical, inexpensive, and focuses on building confidence and self-respect, rather than just preparing for exams. \n3. **Intrinsic and Practical Skills**: It mentions developing skills like cooking and fixing things to build self-confidence and problem-solving abilities, indicating that skills aren't just about academic marks but also practical learning and life skills.\nNow, let's match this with the given options:\n- **Option A: come from their parents**: This is not the main point. While parents can influence skill development, the focus of the passage is on the variability and development of practical skills.\n- **Option B: have nothing to do with their education**: The passage does not support this. It actually discusses a different kind of education (practical education) that affects skill development.\n- **Option C: may be different**: This directly aligns with the statement that children's skills vary, being skilled in some areas while poor in others.\n- **Option D: have something to do with their marks in the exams**: The passage argues against this by emphasizing non-academic, practical education over mere exam preparation.\nTherefore, the most appropriate option based on the passage is **Option C: may be different**.", "pred_ans": "C", "wrap_que": "Q: article:             Trip 1  Black Bear Count There have been fires in this area in the last few years and the Office of the National Park is not sure how many black bears are still living.

In a large city.', 'B. In a park in the mountains.', 'C. In a special zoo.', 'D. In three different countries.']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article describes three trips, all of which mention being part of natural areas, specifically mentioning a national park and valleys in the context of mountains. 1. Trip 1 mentions being part of a national park for counting black bears, which suggests a natural setting. 2. Trip 2 is described as a walk in the Blue Mountains, within a part of the national park, indicating a mountainous area. 3. Trip 3 involves a nighttime adventure in the Dungog Valley and requires walking over terrain typically found in mountainous and park settings. All these trips discussed are set in natural, mountainous environments rather than in cities, zoos, or different countries. Hence, the most appropriate option describing where these trips are is: 'B. In a park in the mountains.' \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             Two traveling angels   stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guestroom. Instead the angels were given some space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied,\"Things aren't always what they seem.\"     The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable   farmer. After sharing a little food they had, the farmer and his wife let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, \"How could this happen?\" \"Why didn't you watch out for the cow? The first family had everything, yet you watched over his house,\" she accused  . \"The second family had little but was willing to share everything, you didn't help.\" \"Things aren't always what they seem,\" the angel replied. \"When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he wouldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I asked God if the angel could take the cow instead. So things aren't always what they seem.\"             question:             Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?             options:             [\"A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.\", 'B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.', 'C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.', 'D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why the older angel repaired the hole for the rich family, let's consider the story: - The older angel saw a hole in the wall of the basement where the wealthy family let them stay. She repaired it. - The younger angel inquired why she did that, and the older angel responded, \"Things aren't always what they seem.\" - Later, it is revealed that the hole in the wall contained gold. The older angel sealed the hole to prevent the wealthy and greedy owner from discovering the gold because he was unwilling to share his fortune. With this context in mind, let's examine the options: - **A. Because she didn't like the greedy owner.** While the owner was indeed greedy, the action was more about preventing the owner from accessing the gold than a reaction based on her personal feelings toward the owner. - **B. Because she wanted to save the gold for the poor.** There's no indication she intended to save the gold specifically for the poor; her intention was to protect it from the greedy owner. - **C. Because the basement was too cold to stay in.** This option doesn't relate to the reason she repaired the hole. - **D. Because she believed that one should always be ready to offer help. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             Friends and Buddies This program is planned for teenagers who have special needs with the goal of meeting within a community with other peers .

Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. 4. **Banana Splits**: This program takes place on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:30 pm. Therefore, it is not available on Saturdays. Given the information above, the only program available on Saturdays is the \"Club Saturday Swim.\" Thus, if you have free time only on Saturday, you can go to: - **B. Club Saturday Swim** \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             The campaign is over. The celebrations have ended. And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.    The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations?     Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"    Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.        However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.    Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.    It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"    In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.    \"When the G8 meets, the four most important people in the room will be the president of China, the prime minister of India, the prime minister of Japan and Barak Obama,\" he told London's The Times newspaper. \"It will be the first time we've seen that on our television screens. That will be a huge psychological shift   for both the white people and the color1ed ones in the world.\"             question:             For years, before Obama was elected president of the US,   _  .             options:             ['A. Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks', 'B. blacks could only find role models on the basketball court', \"C. minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\", 'D. American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area']\nA: Let's think step by step. The article discusses the impact of Barack Obama's election as the first African-American President of the United States on race relations and role models for black communities. It notes that before Obama's presidency, many African-Americans looked to athletes and musicians, such as Kobe Bryant, for inspiration. The article particularly mentions a student who noted that \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore,\" suggesting that before Obama, prominent figures in sports were among the few available role models for black communities. Let's examine the options: - Option A: \"Kobe was the only role model for all the blacks\" - This is an exaggeration. While Kobe Bryant was a significant role model, he was not the only one. - Option B: \"Blacks could only find role models on the basketball court\" - The article implies that sports and music were primary areas where role models were found, not exclusively on the basketball court. - Option C: \"Minorities in America couldn't find role models in their real life\" - This is not mentioned. The article focuses on the types of role models rather than their existence in real life. - Option D: \"American blacks had no role model who was successful in political area\" - This aligns with the article's content, as Obama is noted as a \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is D.\n\nQ: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \" Multitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine why children spend more time using electronic devices, let's analyze the information provided in the article and consider each option: 1. **Option A: Because more electronic devices are available to them.** - The article mentions a \"huge explosion in mobile devices\" and notes that the number of children with cell phones increased from four out of ten to seven out of ten in just five years. This increase in availability supports the idea that children spend more time using electronic devices because more devices are available to them. 2. **Option B: Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.** - While the article highlights that new and exciting devices are hitting the stores every year, it doesn't directly state that this is a primary reason for increased usage. The article emphasizes availability more than excitement. 3. **Option C: Because they have less other activities.** - The article mentions concerns that with increased device use, children might be missing out on activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends, but it doesn't claim that children have fewer activities available to them compared to the past. 4. **Option D: Because they have less homework to do.** - The article does not mention anything about children having less homework, so this option is not supported by the provided \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']\nA: Let's think step by step. To determine when the earthquake attacked the area, consider the following details: 1. **Time of Occurrence**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m., which is typically a late morning time. 2. **Daily Activities**: - **A. Sleep in bed**: At 11:50 a.m., most people are unlikely to be sleeping in bed, as this is a time when people are generally awake and involved in their daily activities. - **B. Work in the fields**: It is possible that some people might be working in the fields, depending on the region's agricultural practices and the day of the week. - **C. Walk in the streets**: This is a normal activity that can occur at any time, including late morning. - **D. Stay at home**: Many people might stay at home, especially those not engaged in work or outdoor activities during this time. Given these considerations, the most unlikely activity for most people at 11:50 a.m. would be \"A. sleep in bed,\" as it is late in the morning when people are generally up and about. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda. They knew, each one of them,that their productivity had ceased .When a fruit tree ceases to bear its fruit,it is dying.And it is even so with man. What 1s the answer to a long and happy existence in this world of ours? I think I found it long ago in a passage from the book of Genesis which caught my eye while I was looking through my Bible. The words were few,but they became memorably impressed on my mind:\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread.\" To me,that has been a challenge from my earliest recollections (memories).In fact,the battle of life,of existence,is a challenge to everyone.The immortal words of St.Paul,too,have been and always will be a great inspiration to me.At the end of the road 1 want to be able to feel that I have fought a good fight,I have finished the course,I have kept the faith.             question:             We learn from the passage that the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was a wealthy person in the community', 'B. held.a positive attitude towards an active life', 'C. was fond of associating with celebrities', 'D. kept a secret of the reason why he was so impressed']\nA: Let's think step by step. To address the question, we need to analyze the information and themes presented in the passage and evaluate which option most accurately describes the author's perspective or actions. 1. **Understanding Wealth**: The author discusses the difficulties of acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly. They observe men who were once successful and respected but now seem to be lacking purpose, suggesting that material wealth alone does not lead to happiness. 2. **Personal Reflection**: The author reflects on a passage from Genesis, emphasizing the importance of working for one's sustenance (\"In the sweat of the face shall you eat the bread\"). This implies the author values hard work and an active life. 3. **Philosophical Insight**: The author also draws inspiration from St. Paul, indicating a focus on fighting a good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith. Again, this highlights an attitude of perseverance and active engagement in life. Now, let's evaluate the options: - **A. was a wealthy person in the community**: There is no direct evidence in the passage to support this claim about the author's own wealth. The author discusses others' wealth but not their own. - **B. held a positive attitude towards an active life**: This aligns with the passage's emphasis on actively engaging in life \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is B.\n\nQ: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']\nA: Let's think step by step. The author states in the article that human cloning is wrong for four main reasons. The reasons mentioned include: 1. Identity issues: Cloning could prevent people from possessing their own identities and personalities. 2. Power struggle: Cloning gives the person performing the cloning more power over the cloned individual's physical identity, ignoring their rights. 3. Risk to embryos: The process of cloning involves significant embryo loss, as evidenced by the cloning of Dolly the sheep. 4. Danger to the clone and birth mother: Cloning poses risks to both the clone and the birth mother, with a high failure rate observed in animal tests. Therefore, based on the article, the correct answer is option 'A. 4'. \nTherefore, among A through D, the answer is A.\n\nQ: article:\n            Chinese are very generous when it comes to educating their children. Not caring about the money, parents often send their children to the best schools or even abroad to England, the United States or Australia. They also want their children to take extra-course activities where they will learn a musical instrument or ballet or other classes which will give them a head start in life. The Chinese believe that the more expensive an education is, the better it is. So the parents will spend an unreasonable amount of money on education. Even poor couples will buy a computer for their son or daughter.\nHowever, what most parents fail to see is that the best early education they can give their children is usually very cheap.\nParents can see that their children's skills vary, skilled in some areas while poor in others. What most parents fail to realize though, is that today's children lack   self-respect and self-confidence.\nThe problem is that parents are only educating their children on how to take multiple-choice tests and how to study well, but parents aren't teaching them the most important skills they need to be confident, happy and clever.\nParents can achieve this by teaching practical skills like cooking, sewing and doing housework.\nTeaching a child to cook will improve many of the skills that he will need later in life. Cooking demands patience and time. It's an enjoyable but difficult experiment. A good cook always tries to improve his cooking, so he will learn to work hard and gradually to finish his job successfully. His result, a well-cooked dinner, will give him much satisfaction and a lot of self-confidence.\nSome old machines , such as a broken radio or TV set that you give your children to play with will make him curious   and arouse his interest He will spend hours looking at them, trying to fix them; your child might become an engineer when he grows up. These activities aren't merely teaching a child to read a book, but rather to think, to use his mind. And that is more important.\n            question:\n            Generally speaking, children's skills  _  .\n            options:\n            A. come from their parents B. have nothing to do with their education C. may be different D. have something to do with their marks in the exams\n         A:  Let's think step by step."}
