Q: dialogue:             M: I am considering dropping my dancing class. I am not making any progress. W: If I were you, I stick with it. It's definitely worth time and effort.             question:             What does the man suggest the woman do?             options:             A. Take a more interesting class. B. Consult her dancing teacher. C. Continue her dancing class.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man suggests the woman do, let's analyze the dialogue and break it down step by step:
1. **Identify the speakers and their perspectives:**
   - M (man) is speaking first, expressing his consideration of dropping his dancing class because he feels he is not making any progress.
   - W (woman) responds by providing advice.
2. **Understand the woman's advice:**
   - The woman suggests, "If I were you, I [would] stick with it."
   - This implies that the woman is advising the man to continue with the dancing class because she believes it is worth the time and effort.
3. **Connect the advice to the options provided:**
   - Option A: "Take a more interesting class" - This does not align with the advice given. The woman suggests perseverance, not changing to a different class.
   - Option B: "Consult her dancing teacher" - This option involves seeking guidance but is not explicitly mentioned in the dialogue.
   - Option C: "Continue her dancing class" - This directly aligns with the woman's advice to "stick with it."
Therefore, the man suggests the equivalent of what the woman advises, which is most logically represented by Option C: "Continue her dancing class."

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Continue her dancing class.

Q: dialogue:             W: Well, I'm afraid my cooking isn't to your taste. M: Actually, I like it very much. W: I'm glad you enjoy it. Let me serve you some more fish. M: No, thank you. I've had enough fish, but I'd like some soup. W: Here it is. Help yourself! M: Thanks. I didn't know you were so good at cooking. If only my wife could learn to cook from you. W: Why not bring your wife next time? I haven't seen her for quite a while. M: OK, I will. She will be very glad to see you, too. Thank you for the wonderful meal.             question:             What does the man think of the woman's cooking?             options:             A. It's very good indeed. B. It's better than what he does. C. It's really terrible.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man thinks of the woman's cooking, let's review their dialogue step by step:
1. The woman initially expresses concern that her cooking might not be to the man's taste: "Well, I'm afraid my cooking isn't to your taste."
2. The man responds positively: "Actually, I like it very much." This indicates that he enjoys the woman's cooking.
3. Later, he thanks the woman again and compliments her cooking skills: "Thanks. I didn't know you were so good at cooking." 
Given these exchanges, particularly the man's statement, "Actually, I like it very much," it's clear that he thinks the woman's cooking is very good.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. It's very good indeed.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. It's very good indeed.

Thank you for the wonderful meal.             question:             What does the woman ask the man to do?             options:             A. Improve cooking skills. B. Bring his wife next time. C. Have some soup.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman asked the man to do, let's review their dialogue step by step:
1. The woman (W) acknowledges that her cooking might not be to the man's (M) taste.
2. The man reassures her that he likes it and receives more fish offered by her.
3. The man declines more fish but asks for soup, which the woman provides.
4. The man compliments her cooking and wishes his wife could learn from her.
5. The woman suggests bringing his wife next time, as she hasn't seen her for a while.
The direct question asked by the woman is about bringing his wife next time. So, the correct answer is:
B. Bring his wife next time.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Bring his wife next time.

Q: dialogue:             M: Look at the girl on the bike! F: Oh, yes she's really a smart girl.             question:             Where are the two persons?             options:             A. At home B. On the street C. In their classroom
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the location of the two persons in the dialogue, we need to analyze the context of their conversation.
1. **Observation**: The conversation is about a girl on a bike. This suggests that the two persons are likely observing her in an environment where biking is possible.
2. **Options**:
   - A. At home: This seems unlikely because they wouldn't typically be seeing a girl on a bike while inside a house.
   - B. On the street: This is the most likely option because streets are common places where people can see others biking.
   - C. In their classroom: This is unlikely because classrooms are usually indoors and not places where you would see someone riding a bike.
3. **Conclusion**: Given that they are observing a girl riding a bike, the most logical location for the two persons is "On the street."
Therefore, the best answer is **B. On the street**.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. On the street.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man wants the woman to do, we need to analyze their exchange.
1. The man (M) asks, "Can you accompany me while I am singing?"
   - This implies the man is asking the woman to provide some form of musical support while he sings.
2. The woman (W) responds, "I don't play very well, but I will give it a try."
   - The woman's response focuses on her ability to "play", not sing, suggesting she is referring to playing an instrument, most likely a piano.
Given these steps, the man's request for accompaniment while singing corresponds to Option C: To play the piano.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. To play the piano.

Q: dialogue:             W: I can't figure out what's wrong with my watch. It was just a month ago that I had it repaired. M: Don't waste your time and money any more. It's very old watch and it is quite worn out.             question:             What does the man mean?             options:             A. The watch is no longer worth repairing. B. It will take about one month to repair the watch. C. It is a good idea to keep the old watch.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man means in the dialogue, we should analyze his statement in the context of the conversation.
1. **Contextual Clues**: 
   - The woman is expressing frustration because her watch, which she had repaired just a month ago, isn't working properly.
   - This implies that the woman is considering repairing the watch again.
2. **Man's Response**:
   - The man advises, "Don't waste your time and money any more."
   - He further explains that "It's very old watch and it is quite worn out."
3. **Interpreting the Man's Intent**:
   - By telling the woman not to "waste your time and money," he suggests that further repair attempts would be futile or not worthwhile.
   - His comment about the watch being "very old" and "quite worn out" implies that the watch's condition is beyond reasonable repair.
4. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option A**: "The watch is no longer worth repairing." This directly aligns with the man's advice to not spend more time and money on it, indicating it's not worth further repairs.
   - **Option B**: "It will take about one month to repair the watch." This doesn't align with the man's

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. The watch is no longer worth repairing.

Q: dialogue:             W: Hello, this is TBC Television Studios. How can I help you? M: Hello. I'm calling because I saw an ad in the campus newspaper. It said you wanted an assistant to work on your local news program. W: Right. But you do realize that we just need volunteers. It's an unpaid position. M: Oh, sure. I understand that. I just want to get some experience working for television news production after I get my degree. W: I see. Well, you'll need to talk to Ms. Black. She is in charge of the program. But first, you'll need to come here to fill out an application form. Can you drop by the studio later today?             question:             Where does the woman work?             options:             A. At a TV station. B. At a university. C. At a newspaper office.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the woman works, we can refer back to the information presented in the dialogue:
1. **Opening Line**: The woman begins by saying, "Hello, this is TBC Television Studios." This is a strong indicator of her workplace, as she is answering the call at that location.
   
2. **Context Clue**: She talks about a local news program and mentions the need for volunteers, which is consistent with the operations of a television station.
3. **Role and Actions**: She is the first point of contact for inquiries about the assistant position for the local news program and directs the caller to fill out an application in person at the studio. These responsibilities align with someone working at a TV station.
Putting this analysis together, the most logical conclusion is that the woman works at a TV station, hence the correct option is:
A. At a TV station.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. At a TV station.

But first, you'll need to come here to fill out an application form. Can you drop by the studio later today?             question:             Why is the man applying for this position?             options:             A. He has recently lost another job. B. He needs a well-paid position. C. He wants some working experience.
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand why the man is applying for the position, we should first analyze the given dialogue to identify his motivations.
1. **Initial Interaction**: The man (M) mentions he saw an ad for an assistant position on a local news program.
2. **Clarification by Woman (W)**: She clarifies that it is a volunteer position, meaning it's unpaid.
3. **Man's Response**: Despite the position being unpaid, he expresses understanding and continues to show interest because he wants to gain experience in television news production after earning his degree.
From the man's response, we can infer that his motivation for applying is to gain relevant experience in the field of television news production, not for monetary compensation or because he lost another job.
Given these points, the most appropriate answer is:
C. He wants some working experience.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He wants some working experience.

A: Let's think step by step.
The dialogue provides some clues about the weather. 
1. M says, "I think it's going to rain." This suggests that it is not currently raining but indicates that rain is likely soon.
2. W responds, "I guess so. The skies are dark and cloudy." This statement provides more direct information about the current weather conditions: the skies are dark and cloudy.
3. Given these details, we can eliminate option A, "It's sunny," because sunny weather would not involve dark and cloudy skies.
4. We can also eliminate option B, "It's raining," because there is no indication in the dialogue that it is currently raining; they are only predicting that it might rain soon.
5. Option C, "It's cloudy," aligns with W's observation that "The skies are dark and cloudy."
Thus, the most appropriate answer is C. It's cloudy.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. It's cloudy.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the location of the two speakers, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. The dialogue begins with "W: Front desk. Can I help you?" which typically indicates that the woman (W) is working at a front desk, a common feature in places like hotels.
2. The man (M) responds with "Yeah, hi, this is Room 327." Mentioning a room number suggests that the man is communicating from a specific room, which is characteristic of a hotel setting where guests are assigned room numbers.
3. The man further asks, "Is your dining room still open?" This question implies that the place they are located has a dining room. Hotels often have dining facilities or restaurants for their guests.
Given these points, the logical conclusion is that the two speakers are in a hotel. The woman is at the hotel front desk, and the man is a guest in one of the hotel's rooms inquiring about the hotel's dining room.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. In a hotel.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. In a hotel.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what they are talking about, let's examine the dialogue:
1. M asks W when she first found the door broken and things missing. This suggests that there has been some intrusion or theft.
2. W mentions discovering this around 5:20 and then calling the police station. Calling the police is a common response when a crime, such as a burglary, has occurred.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. A crime - This aligns well with the dialogue, as finding a door broken and items missing suggests a burglary or theft, which is a type of crime.
B. A traffic accident - There is no mention of a vehicle, roads, or any accident-related discussion, so this option does not fit.
C. A fire - A broken door and missing items do not specifically indicate a fire incident, and there is no mention of flames, smoke, or emergency services related to fires.
Based on the analysis, the most logical option is A. A crime.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. A crime.

To answer the question about the lecture, we should carefully examine the dialogue provided.
1. Initially, F mentioned that the lecture would start at three in the afternoon.
2. However, M responded indicating that there has been a change in the plan. 
3. M clarified that the lecture will now begin at eight tomorrow morning.
Now, let's evaluate the options based on the updated information given by M:
A. It will start at three tomorrow afternoon. - This option is incorrect because the lecture will not start at three, as M indicated the time has been changed.
B. It will start at three this afternoon. - This option is incorrect because the lecture is no longer scheduled for this afternoon according to M's update.
C. It will start at eight tomorrow morning. - This option is correct because this reflects the change provided by M. The lecture is now scheduled for eight tomorrow morning.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man is going to do, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. The woman expresses a desire to know the train times to London but states that their phone is out of order.
2. The man reassures her by saying "Don't worry, Grandma. I'll find out for you on the Internet."
From this dialogue, we can infer that:
- The woman cannot make a phone call due to the phone being out of order and wants information about train times.
- The man responds by offering to use the Internet to find out the train times.
Given these points, the man is intending to use the Internet to find the train times. Thus, the correct option describing what the man is going to do is:
C. Go on the Internet.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Go on the Internet.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine whether the woman will turn off the clock, we need to consider the context of the dialogue. 
1. M asks the woman to turn off the alarm clock. This suggests he might want to sleep longer or doesn't want the alarm to sound.
2. W responds by reminding M that he has a meeting at 8:40. This implies she is considering the need for the alarm to ensure he wakes up in time for the meeting.
Given this exchange:
- W's response suggests she is concerned about the importance of the meeting and the necessity of the alarm to ensure M wakes up on time. 
- Her response doesn't include an agreement to turn off the alarm; instead, it highlights the reason to keep it on.
Based on this analysis, the most likely answer is:
A. No. 
The woman is unlikely to turn off the alarm clock because she is reminding the man of his commitment, which the alarm is intended to help him meet.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. No.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the dialogue:
1. The dialogue consists of two characters, W and M (Peterson).
2. W asks Peterson if they should go and dance.
3. Peterson (M) responds with "OK," indicating agreement, but he requests to wait a minute.
4. Peterson then explains that he has just finished his homework and needs to put it in his desk first.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. He has just cleaned his desk.
- This option is incorrect because the dialogue does not mention anything about Peterson cleaning his desk.
B. He has just finished his homework.
- This option is correct because Peterson explicitly states in the dialogue that he has just finished his homework.
C. He has just finished dancing with his friend.
- This option is incorrect because the action of dancing has not yet occurred; they are about to go and dance.
Based on the given dialogue and options, the correct answer is B. He has just finished his homework.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. He has just finished his homework.

Father: Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? Daughter: Mom said I could take the car to school this morning, and ... Father: Hold on here. I've prepared a few rules regarding the use of the motor vehicles in this house. Daughter: Like what? Father: Let me get my notes here. Daughter: Dad! That looks like a book? Mom, Dad's being mean to me. Father: Okay, let me get my reading glasses here. Okay, here we are. Rule number one: No driving with friends for the first six months. Daughter: What? Father: Teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight. Daughter: But that's not me! Do I really need this lecture? This is such a drag! Father: Furthermore, who really needs a car when a pair of shoes will work? I mean, life was different when I was your age. In fact, I used to walk to school ... Daughter: Yeah, yeah. I know. Both ways uphill in ten feet of snow. I've heard this story many times.

She has just started driver's education classes at school. B. She is taking her driver's license road test today. C. She has her license and wants to drive now.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the girl is excited at the beginning of the conversation, we can analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Daughter's Statement**: The daughter says, "Guess what, Mom. I got it." This indicates that she has recently acquired something significant.
2. **Mother’s Response**: The mother's response, "Great. That's super," suggests that whatever the daughter "got" is a positive accomplishment or event.
3. **Father’s Question**: The father’s question, "So, what did you get me?" shows he is unaware of what the daughter is talking about. The daughter’s reply to the father, "Nothing. I got my driver's license," confirms that the exciting news is about her obtaining her driver’s license.

Father: Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? Daughter: Mom said I could take the car to school this morning, and ... Father: Hold on here. I've prepared a few rules regarding the use of the motor vehicles in this house. Daughter: Like what? Father: Let me get my notes here. Daughter: Dad! That looks like a book? Mom, Dad's being mean to me. Father: Okay, let me get my reading glasses here. Okay, here we are. Rule number one: No driving with friends for the first six months. Daughter: What? Father: Teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight. Daughter: But that's not me! Do I really need this lecture? This is such a drag! Father: Furthermore, who really needs a car when a pair of shoes will work? I mean, life was different when I was your age. In fact, I used to walk to school ... Daughter: Yeah, yeah. I know. Both ways uphill in ten feet of snow. I've heard this story many times. Father: Yeah. Oh, where were we? Oh yes. Rule number two: You always must wear your seat belt and obey the rules of the road. Daughter: Duh. I wasn't born yesterday. Father: Okay, rule number three: You can't drive long distances at night because you might get drowsy and drive off the road. But driving to the movie theater is fine. Daughter: But the movie theater is right across the street from our house. Father: Exactly, so you can just park in the driveway and walk there. Daughter: Mom! Dad's being unreasonable. Father: And rule number four: You should never use a cell phone while driving. That could cause an accident. Daughter: But YOU do. Father: That's different. Daughter: How's it different? You even need my help to turn your cell phone on. Father: And rule number five: Remember that I love you, and I'm just a protective father who wants his daughter to always be safe. Daughter: Does that mean I can take the car now? Father: Well, I don't know. Daughter: Please dad, please. You're the best dad in the whole wide world. Father: That's not what you said earlier. Daughter: Hey, having the car keys in my hands changes my whole perspective on life. Father: Well, okay. I guess if I'm considered the best dad in the world for five minutes, then I'll accept that. Daughter: Yeah. Father: Okay, but drive carefully and don't forget to fill up the car with gas before you come home. [Bye. Love ya guys.] Okay. Hon, do you think I did the right thing? Mother: Yeah. She has to grow up sometime.             question:             Which statement is an example of why the father created rule number 1?             options:             A. Some kids drive before obtaining a license. B. Teenagers often drive at high speeds. C. Young drivers sometimes drink and drive.
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks us to identify which statement explains why the father created rule number 1. Here's a breakdown:
1. **Rule Number 1:** The father said, "No driving with friends for the first six months." 
2. **Reason for the Rule:** He mentioned that "teenagers often lack the judgment to drive responsibly, especially when several teenagers are involved. I mean they speed, they joyride, they cruise around town way past midnight."
Given this context, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A:** "Some kids drive before obtaining a license." - This does not directly relate to the father's concern about driving responsibly with friends.
  
- **Option B:** "Teenagers often drive at high speeds." - This directly aligns with the father's concern. He mentioned that teenagers speed, which contributes to the lack of responsible driving when with friends.
- **Option C:** "Young drivers sometimes drink and drive." - While a valid concern for driving safety, the father did not specifically mention this as a reason for rule number 1.
Thus, the statement that is an example of why the father created rule number 1 is:
**B. Teenagers often drive at high speeds.**

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Teenagers often drive at high speeds.

She has to grow up sometime.             question:             Why does the father ask the daughter not to drive at night?             options:             A. The roads tend to become icy and slippery. B. The girl might fall asleep at the wheel. C. It is more difficult to see obstacles in the road.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the father asks the daughter not to drive at night, let's examine the relevant section of the dialogue:
The father states: "You can't drive long distances at night because you might get drowsy and drive off the road."
From this statement, we can see the father's concern is that driving at night may cause the daughter to become drowsy, increasing the risk of falling asleep at the wheel and potentially having an accident.
Now, we can analyze the provided options:
A. The roads tend to become icy and slippery.
- This is not mentioned or hinted at in their conversation, so it does not align with the father's reasoning.
B. The girl might fall asleep at the wheel.
- This directly corresponds with the father's concern that driving at night might cause drowsiness leading to an accident. Therefore, this option is accurate.
C. It is more difficult to see obstacles in the road.
- Although this can be a concern for night driving, it is not specified in this dialogue as a reason given by the father.
By breaking this down, we can conclude that the most accurate answer is:
B. The girl might fall asleep at the wheel.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. The girl might fall asleep at the wheel.

The rule is an old traffic law that has changed. B. The girl tells the dad the rule doesn't apply to her. C. The father doesn't obey the rule either.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the daughter dismisses or does not take rule number 4 seriously, we need to consider the context of the conversation and what is directly stated:
1. Rule number 4 states: "You should never use a cell phone while driving. That could cause an accident."
2. Immediately after the father states this rule, the daughter responds with: "But YOU do." This indicates that the daughter is pointing out that her father does not follow the rule himself.
3. The daughter's dismissal is based on the fact that her father does not model the behavior he expects from her.
4. The father attempts to respond to the daughter's accusation with: "That's different," but the daughter is not convinced, and she further highlights his lack of proficiency with his cell phone.
5. The underlying logic for the daughter's dismissal is rooted in perceived hypocrisy; she sees the rule as less credible because the father does not adhere to it.
Thus, the correct option that matches this reasoning is:
C. The father doesn't obey the rule either.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. The father doesn't obey the rule either.

The mom decides to drive the daughter to school. C. The girl persuades the father to let her drive the car.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct ending to the conversation, we'll analyze the events and context provided in the dialogue.
1. The daughter informs her parents that she has obtained her driver's license, which introduces the main subject of the conversation: her desire to drive the car.
2. The father introduces a set of rules about driving, indicating his concerns and protective nature. Throughout the dialogue, the daughter expresses her frustration with these rules, especially since she just received her license and desires more freedom.
3. The father's rules seem strict to the daughter, but he emphasizes their importance for her safety. The father is being cautious and tries to ensure his daughter understands their purpose.
4. The daughter consistently reacts with complaints and attempts to persuade her father, showing a typical teenager-parent dynamic where the child wants more freedom, and the parent wants to ensure safety.
5. Toward the end of the conversation, the daughter tries to sweet-talk her father by calling him "the best dad in the whole wide world," which implies she's trying to persuade him to let her drive the car despite the rules.
6. The father finally concedes, saying, "Well, okay. I guess if I'm considered the best dad in the world for five minutes, then I'll accept that." This shows he agrees to let her

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. The girl persuades the father to let her drive the car.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the man's opinion of the woman's car, we should analyze the dialogue.
1. The woman asks the man what he thinks about her new car, which implies she is seeking his opinion.
2. The man responds, "To be honest, it is no better than mine." This indicates that he perceives her car to be roughly equivalent to his own in terms of quality or value. 
3. The key phrase here is "no better than mine." This suggests that he does not see any superiority in her car compared to his.
Given the options:
A. Her car is cheaper.
B. Her car is not so good.
C. Her car is better than his.
The man's statement that her car is "no better than mine" aligns most closely with option B. Her car is not so good. 
This is because the statement implies that her car is not superior, which fits with the idea that it is not particularly good according to his standards. 
Thus, the correct answer is B. Her car is not so good.

In the Book Shop. C. In a tall building.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where they are talking, we need to analyze the dialogue and see if there are any contextual clues.
1. **Content of Dialogue**: The female speaker (F) is asking for directions to the Book Shop. This suggests that she has not yet reached her destination.
2. **Speaker's Response**: The male speaker (M) provides directions, indicating that they are not currently at the Book Shop, but somewhere from which someone can give directions to it.
3. **Nature of Interaction**: This exchange typically occurs in public or open spaces where people commonly request and provide directions, such as on a street.
4. **Location of Conversation**:
   - A. **In a street**: This option fits best, as it is common for someone to ask for directions on a street.
   - B. **In the Book Shop**: Unlikely, as the female speaker would not need directions to a place she is already in.
   - C. **In a tall building**: While possible, there’s no indication of being inside a building, especially since they are talking about a distant location.
Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer would be:
A. In a street.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when the concert will finish, let's break down the information given:
1. The concert starts at six thirty (6:30).
2. The concert will last three hours.
To find the finishing time, we simply need to add the duration of the concert (three hours) to the starting time (6:30):
- 6:30 plus one hour is 7:30.
- 7:30 plus another hour is 8:30.
- 8:30 plus the final hour is 9:30.
Thus, the concert will finish at 9:30.
Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Nine thirty.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Nine thirty.

W: Well, I was away for a couple of weeks. But I'm fine now. Ah! You were going to the States, weren't you? M: I planned to go there, but I didn't. W: Oh, didn't you? M: What I have been doing is reorganizing the whole department non-stop since I saw you. And this is the first time I've been in here since Christmas. W: Well, it's good to see you.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the reason why Mike and Jean haven't seen each other lately, we need to look for clues in their conversation:
1. **Jean’s Mention of Absence**: Jean mentions that Mike hasn't been in for ages, implying they haven't seen each other for a while.
2. **Mike’s Explanation**: Mike says, "What I have been doing is reorganizing the whole department non-stop since I saw you." This indicates that his work commitments have kept him occupied.
3. **Jean’s Mention of Illness**: There is a mention that Jean wasn't well and was away for a couple of weeks. However, there's no indication that Mike's frequent absence is due to illness.
4. **Mike Not Going to the States**: Although Mike mentions that he planned to go to the States but didn’t, he doesn’t imply that travel was the reason for his absence.
Considering these points, the most logical reason why they haven't seen each other is because Mike has been busy with work, specifically reorganizing his department.
The answer is:  
C. He has been busy.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He has been busy.

M: Yes, but it's not there. W: Well, if it's a recent book, it won't be in the card list. All information about books since 1995 is in the computer. I advise you to try that. M: No wonder! This book is published in 1998. W: All you have to do is to type in the title or the writer's name. M: Do you mean it will tell me whether the book is out or not? W: Yes, it will. It will also give you the due date if it is out. If the book is in the library, it will tell you where you can find the book.             question:             Where does the conversation probably take place?             options:             A. In a library. B. In a bookstore. C. In a classroom.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the conversation takes place, we need to analyze the context and the nature of the dialogue:
1. **Participants and their roles:** The conversation is between two people, W and M, discussing a research paper for history and the availability of a book.
2. **Key points in the conversation:**
   - M mentions needing a major book for a research paper.
   - W suggests trying the computer for information since all books published after 1995 are listed there.
   - M acknowledges the book was published in 1998.
   - W explains how to find information about the book, including its checkout status and location within a collection.
3. **Environment indicators:**
   - The conversation discusses a card list and computerized catalog, which are features commonly found in libraries.
   - The process of checking if a book is "out" or available and finding its location suggests a library setting where books are borrowed.
4. **Options analysis:**
   - A. In a library: This matches the conversation context as libraries have catalog systems, card lists, and systems to track book availability.
   - B. In a bookstore: Bookstores do not typically have systems to indicate due dates or whether a book is "out," as they sell books rather than

Writing a research paper. C. Returning some books.
A: Let's think step by step.
The dialogue involves a conversation between a man (M) and a woman (W). The man mentions that he has to do a research paper for history and needs a major book that he cannot find. This indicates that the man is in search of a book.
1. The man states, "I have to do a research paper for history," which relates to option B (Writing a research paper), but the immediate action he is involved in is related to finding a book.
   
2. He then expresses that there's a major book he needs, but he can't locate it, pointing more directly to action relating to a book. This aligns with option A (Looking for a book).
3. The woman offers advice on how to find the book using the computer, suggesting that the man's primary concern at this moment is locating the book.
4. There is no mention of the man returning any books, which means option C (Returning some books) is not applicable.
The dialogue centers around the man's difficulty in finding a book he needs for his research paper. Therefore, the best answer to what the man is doing is:
A. Looking for a book.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Looking for a book.

To refer to the card list. B. To return the due books. C. To make use of the computer.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman tells the man to do, let's examine their conversation:
1. The man expresses that he has a problem finding a major book for his research paper.
2. The woman first asks if he tried the card list, and the man confirms he did, but the book is not there.
3. The woman then explains that if the book is recent, it won't be in the card list and mentions that all information about books since 1995 is stored in the computer.
4. She advises him to use the computer to find the book.
From this conversation, it's clear that the woman's primary advice to the man is to use the computer to search for the book. 
Now, let's look at the options:
A. To refer to the card list. - This is incorrect because the woman initially asks if he tried the card list, but then she advises him to use the computer instead.
B. To return the due books. - This option is irrelevant to the conversation. There is no mention of returning due books.
C. To make use of the computer. - This is the correct answer because the woman suggests that he use the computer to find the book, explaining that recent book information is stored there.
Therefore, the answer is C. To make

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man didn't do yesterday, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. F asks M when he started his work last night.
2. M responds that he began to work after the TV news finished.
From M's response, we can infer:
- M watched the TV news because he started working after it finished. This eliminates option A (Watch TV).
- M explicitly states that he began to work after the TV news, so he did work. This eliminates option C (Work).
The dialogue does not mention anything about playing games, and since M's activities were centered around watching TV and working, it's reasonable to conclude that he did not play games.
Therefore, the correct option is B. Play games.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Play games.

Writing his term paper. C. Having a coffee break.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man is doing now, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. The woman (W) asks if the man (M) has been wasting his time on online games again. This suggests she thinks he might be playing games now or recently.
2. The man responds by saying "Not really," which implies he's not currently spending a lot of time on games, or not as much as the woman assumes.
3. He explains that he has worked a lot on his term paper over the week, stating he needs a break. This suggests he is not currently writing his term paper because he's indicating he needs a rest from his recent work on it.
Since the man needs a break and is addressing the question about wasting time on games, the implication is that he is currently taking a break, potentially doing something leisurely like playing computer games.
So, the most logical answer, considering the context, is:
A. Playing computer games.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Playing computer games.

Q: dialogue:             M: This TV set is getting worse and worse. Now it doesn't work at all. W: Here's an advertisement on the newspaper about a big TV sale.

They have to bargain on the sale. B. The TV set is usually on sale. C. They go to buy a TV set at a bargain price.
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what the woman suggests, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. **M's Statement**: "This TV set is getting worse and worse. Now it doesn't work at all."
   - This indicates that there is a problem with their current TV set, and it may need replacing since it doesn't work at all.
2. **W's Response**: "Here's an advertisement on the newspaper about a big TV sale. Usually a big sale like this would have some good bargains."
   - The woman refers to an advertisement about a big TV sale, implying there are opportunities to find a good deal. She mentions that sales like this "would have some good bargains."
Now, let's analyze the options:
A. **They have to bargain on the sale.**
   - This option suggests actively negotiating prices, which is not directly implied by the woman's response. She mentions finding bargains, not haggling for a lower price.
B. **The TV set is usually on sale.**
   - This option misinterprets the woman's statement. She's talking about a specific current sale, not the usual status of the TV set being on sale.
C. **They go to buy a TV set at a bargain price.**
   - This best aligns with the woman's suggestion. She

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. They go to buy a TV set at a bargain price.

But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams, so they walk. W: In other words, the Romans do what everyone else does. M: Yes, but they do it differently. Everything is different. W: What do you mean? M: Well, the climate is different for a start. It doesn't rain so much as it does in England. The sun shines more often. W: I envy them for the sun. M: I Know. You hate the rain, don't you? W: I certainly do. M: And a Roman really loves life. They always eat spaghetti and drink wine. W: Not always, but they like a good meal. Lots of tourists go to Rome just for food. M: Sure.             question:             What's the relationship between the two persons?             options:             A. Salesman and customer. B. Wife and husband. C. Teacher and student.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the relationship between the two persons in the dialogue, let's analyze the conversation:
1. **Content and Tone of the Dialogue**:
   - The dialogue is informal and friendly, suggesting a personal relationship.
   - They share opinions and personal feelings about the weather, life in Rome, and personal preferences like the dislike for rain.
2. **Discussion Topics**:
   - They talk about lifestyle in Rome, weather differences, and food, which are casual topics typically discussed between friends or family.
   - The mention of personal preferences, such as hate for rain and envy for the sun, indicates familiarity.
3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A. Salesman and customer**: This option is unlikely since the conversation seems too personal and informal for a professional setting.
   - **B. Wife and husband**: This option is possible since the dialogue's familiarity, casual tone, and sharing of personal opinions are consistent with a conversation between spouses.
   - **C. Teacher and student**: This option is less likely as the dialogue lacks a formal or educational tone that typically characterizes teacher-student interactions.
Considering the level of familiarity and the context of the conversation, the most likely relationship between M and W is that they are **B. Wife and husband

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Wife and husband.

Q: dialogue:             M: When in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say. W: What do the Romans do? M: They live in Rome, of course, and go to work by car or bus. But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams, so they walk. W: In other words, the Romans do what everyone else does. M: Yes, but they do it differently. Everything is different. W: What do you mean? M: Well, the climate is different for a start. It doesn't rain so much as it does in England. The sun shines more often. W: I envy them for the sun. M: I Know. You hate the rain, don't you? W: I certainly do. M: And a Roman really loves life. They always eat spaghetti and drink wine. W: Not always, but they like a good meal. Lots of tourists go to Rome just for food. M: Sure.             question:             What does the woman hate?             options:             A. Rain. B. Sun. C. Spaghetti.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman hates, we need to look at the dialogue and identify where she expresses her dislike.
1. The man says, "The climate is different for a start. It doesn't rain so much as it does in England. The sun shines more often."
2. The woman responds, "I envy them for the sun."
3. The man then says, "I know. You hate the rain, don't you?"
4. The woman confirms, "I certainly do."
From this exchange, it's clear that the woman hates the rain, as she explicitly states, "I certainly do," in response to the man's comment about her disliking rain.
Therefore, the answer is:
A. Rain.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Rain.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the answer, we need to identify the reason lots of tourists go to Rome as stated in the dialogue.
1. M and W are discussing Rome and its differences compared to other places. They mention aspects like traffic, climate, and lifestyle.
2. In the dialogue, W comments on how Romans eat spaghetti and drink wine, to which M agrees, and they note that tourists are attracted to Rome for its food: "Lots of tourists go to Rome just for food."
3. The question asks specifically what lots of tourists go to Rome for, and the dialogue clearly mentions the reason as "food."
Given the options:
A. Different - This is a description but not the specific reason mentioned in the dialogue.
B. Food - This directly matches what the dialogue indicates as a reason tourists go to Rome.
C. Shining sun - Although the sun is discussed, it is not given as the reason tourists go to Rome.
Thus, the correct answer is:
B. Food.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Food.

Q: dialogue:             W: What do you think of your hotel? M: Not very good, I'm afraid.             question:             What does the woman mean?             options:             A. She thinks the hotel is not very good. B. She wants to know how the man found the hotel. C. She wants to know how the man likes the hotel.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman means, let's break down the dialogue and the options provided:
- The dialogue begins with the woman (W) asking the man (M) a question: "What do you think of your hotel?"
- The man's response is: "Not very good, I'm afraid."
Next, let's analyze the options:
A. She thinks the hotel is not very good.
- This option focuses on the woman's opinion about the hotel. However, the dialogue provides the man's opinion, not the woman's.
B. She wants to know how the man found the hotel.
- This option suggests the woman is inquiring about the process the man went through to discover or book the hotel. However, the woman's question "What do you think of your hotel?" is more about his opinion or experience, not about the process of finding it.
C. She wants to know how the man likes the hotel.
- This option aligns with the woman's question, as she is asking for the man's opinion or feelings about the hotel.
Given the dialogue and the options, the most accurate interpretation of the woman's question is that she wants to know how the man likes the hotel. Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. She wants to know how the man likes the hotel.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. She wants to know how the man likes the hotel.

Q: dialogue:             W: Hi, Mike! How are you feeling now? M: How did you know I was here? Is it Tom? W: I was talking with Bob yesterday and I learnt your right leg had been injured. How did it happen? M: Their right back Tom knocked me down when I rushed to their goal with the ball. W: Wow! He must have hit you hard. M: Of course. He hit me from the back and sent me rolling over and over. At the time I had a lot of pain. Anyway, they brought me here. W: Nothing serious, I hope. M: The doctor said there weren't any internal injuries, but that I'd better stay here a couple of days. W: Well, Mike. Take it easy. M: Thank you for your coming. And thanks for the flowers.             question:             Where does the conversation take place?             options:             A. In a hospital. B. In a playground. C. In the man's home.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the conversation takes place, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. The conversation seems to be between W (a visitor) and M (Mike), who is the one that got injured.
2. W greets Mike and asks about his well-being, suggesting concern for his health.
3. Mike asks how W knew he was "here," implying a specific location.
4. W mentions learning from Bob about Mike's injured leg.
5. Mike describes an incident during a sports match where he was knocked down.
6. Mike mentions that he was in a lot of pain and says, "Anyway, they brought me here."
7. W expresses hope that Mike's condition isn't serious.
8. Mike recounts what the doctor said about staying "here" for a couple of days.
9. W advises Mike to take it easy.
10. Mike thanks W for visiting and for the flowers.
Based on the details:
- The specific mention of being "brought here" and staying for a couple of days implies a medical facility, as that's a place where injured individuals would receive care and stay for observation.
- The mention of a doctor further supports that this place is likely a hospital.
- The presence of flowers suggests a get-well-soon gesture typical when visiting

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. In a hospital.

C. He was knocked down in the street.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we know about the man, let's examine the dialogue carefully:
1. **Injured playing a sport**: Mike mentions that he was knocked down by Tom, "Their right back," when he was rushing to their goal with the ball. This indicates he was playing a sport, likely football (soccer).
2. **Was not on the same team as Tom**: Mike refers to Tom as "Their right back," suggesting that Tom was on the opposing team, not on the same team as Mike.
3. **Knocked down during the game**: The context implies that Mike's injury happened during a sports event and not on the street.
Given this analysis, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A**: "He got injured in a football match" – This fits with the information from the dialogue, as Mike describes getting injured while attempting to score a goal, indicating a football context.
- **Option B**: "He was on the same team as Tom" – This contradicts the information, as Mike's wording suggests that Tom was on the opposing team.
- **Option C**: "He was knocked down in the street" – There's no mention or implication of a street; this scenario is inconsistent with the dialogue.
Therefore

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. He got injured in a football match.

Q: dialogue:             Norman: Hey, neighbor. How's it going? Shawn: Fine. How about you? Norman: Okay. Huh, by the way, my wife and I are going out of town this weekend, and I was wondering if you could take care of some of our animals while we're gone. You know our dog, Jaws, don't you? Shawn: Yeah. My leg still hurts from the last incident. Norman: Hey, he's just a playful little beast. Shawn: Right. Norman: Hey, he likes to bark a little, and his bark is worse than his bite. Shawn: Oh yeah. Norman: Just feed him a can of dog food a day, and make sure he has plenty of water in his dish. [Oh] And then, take him for a walk around the block. Shawn: Well, how about if I just throw a Frisbee over the fence to give him some exercise? Wouldn't that work? Norman: Ah, and then, he likes to watch the 3:00 soap opera on Channel 4 [What?] ... and brush his teeth after you give you some doggie treats around 4:00. Shawn: Man, you really pamper your dog. Norman: And, then brush his fur for about twenty minutes. He tends to shed this time of year. [Ah, what?] And then scratch him around the ears. Otherwise, he feels neglected. Shawn: Is that it? Norman: Well, and then there's Claws. Shawn: Claws? Who's Claws. Norman: Oh, he's the cat we adopted from the animal shelter, but he's a little temperamental. Shawn: What do you mean "temperamental"? Norman: Well, he has mood swings [Mood swings?], but he's been doing better since he's been going to the animal therapist. Shawn: A therapist? Norman: So, be sure to feed him a half cup of cat food two times a day [What? A therapist ...], and don't forget to put out (on) some soft classical music during his nap time at 2:40 p.m. But don't let him out of the house because he might run away and chase the neighbor's dog. Shawn: You have some high-maintenance animals. Norman: Not really. And, don't forget to change the cat litter daily, or he might have an accident on the carpet. [Oh, great.] And finally, there's Buttercup. Shawn: Buttercup? Who's Buttercu ...? I'm afraid to ask. Norman: Ah, she's a sweetie [What?] ... if you know how to handle her right. [Oh, great.] Wait. Let me get her for you. Here you are. Shawn: That's ... That's a snake ...[Hold her.] That's a big snake with big fangs. Does the snake go to a therapist, too? Norman: Of course not ... just an anger-management class. Shawn: Oh! What? Norman: I'm joking. Buttercup is a very docile creature, and she never bites anyone she likes. If she doesn't, you'll know because she starts hissing and staring at you ... kind like what she's doing now. Shawn: Well, I'm leaving. You must be going out of you mind to think I'm going to watch a zoo full of misunderstood animals. You'd better hire some professional help 'cause I wouldn't watch them even if you paid me a million dollars.             question:             What is one of Shawn's concern about the dog?             options:             A. It eats too much food at one time. B. The dog might mess on his carpet. C. It can be somewhat aggressive.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine Shawn's concern about the dog, let's recap the conversation between Norman and Shawn, focusing on their discussion about the dog, Jaws:
1. **Initial Mention**: Norman asks Shawn to take care of their dog, Jaws, while they are out of town, to which Shawn responds with some concern about a previous incident. Shawn mentions, "Yeah. My leg still hurts from the last incident."
2. **Norman's Description**: Norman describes Jaws as a "playful little beast," and mentions that "his bark is worse than his bite." The language suggests the dog has been aggressive or difficult in the past, as Shawn seems skeptical or jokingly dismissive about Jaws' demeanor.
3. **Understanding Shawn's Concern**: Given Shawn's previous mention of an incident involving his leg, it appears his concern is about Jaws being aggressive. This is consistent with the idea that Shawn had an unpleasant experience with Jaws before.
Now let's map this understanding to the provided options:
- **A. It eats too much food at one time.**: There is no discussion in the dialogue about Jaws having issues with eating too much food at one time. This option does not address Shawn's concern.
- **B. The dog might

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. It can be somewhat aggressive.

Take the dog for some exercise with a Frisbee. B. Feed him an afternoon doggie treat for a snack. C. Let the dog watch a program on television.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what Shawn is supposed to do between 3:00-4:00 p.m. for the dog, let's go through the dialogue carefully.
1. Norman mentions specific tasks for the care of the dog, Jaws. 
2. One of his comments is: "Ah, and then, he likes to watch the 3:00 soap opera on Channel 4."
3. This timing of 3:00 coincides with the requirement in the question, which specifies the time frame between 3:00-4:00 p.m.
Referring to these lines, it is clear that Norman wants the dog to watch a program on television at 3:00 p.m.
Thus, the correct answer is:
C. Let the dog watch a program on television.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Let the dog watch a program on television.

The cat becomes a little moody at times. B. The cat will run away if it gets outside the house. C. The cat enjoys listening to rock music.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which point is NOT true about the cat, let's examine the dialogue:
1. **Point A**: "The cat becomes a little moody at times." - Norman mentions that the cat has mood swings, confirming that the cat is indeed moody, making Point A true.
2. **Point B**: "The cat will run away if it gets outside the house." - Norman advises not to let the cat out of the house because it might run away and chase the neighbor's dog, which supports Point B as true.
3. **Point C**: "The cat enjoys listening to rock music." - Norman suggests putting on some soft classical music during the cat's nap time, indicating that the cat enjoys classical, not rock music. Therefore, Point C is not supported by the dialogue.
So, the point that is NOT true about the cat is:
C. The cat enjoys listening to rock music.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. The cat enjoys listening to rock music.

The snake doesn't care for Shawn at all. B. The snake appears to warm up to him. C. The snake is extremely shy of Shawn.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct inference about the snake's reaction to Shawn, let's consider the context and details provided in the conversation:
1. Norman introduces a snake, Buttercup, to Shawn and describes her as a "very docile creature" that "never bites anyone she likes."
2. However, Norman also notes a sign of Buttercup's displeasure: she starts "hissing and staring" at someone she doesn't like.
3. At the point when Norman is explaining Buttercup's behavior, he specifically mentions, "kind of like what she's doing now," suggesting that Buttercup is indeed hissing and staring at Shawn.
4. This implies that the snake is showing signs of not liking Shawn or feeling uncomfortable around him.
Given these observations, the snake's reaction of hissing and staring at Shawn indicates that:
A. The snake doesn't care for Shawn at all.
This matches option A, which aligns with Buttercup's reaction to Shawn as described by Norman.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. The snake doesn't care for Shawn at all.

Norman: And, then brush his fur for about twenty minutes. He tends to shed this time of year. [Ah, what?] And then scratch him around the ears. Otherwise, he feels neglected. Shawn: Is that it? Norman: Well, and then there's Claws. Shawn: Claws? Who's Claws. Norman: Oh, he's the cat we adopted from the animal shelter, but he's a little temperamental. Shawn: What do you mean "temperamental"? Norman: Well, he has mood swings [Mood swings?], but he's been doing better since he's been going to the animal therapist. Shawn: A therapist? Norman: So, be sure to feed him a half cup of cat food two times a day [What? A therapist ...], and don't forget to put out (on) some soft classical music during his nap time at 2:40 p.m. But don't let him out of the house because he might run away and chase the neighbor's dog. Shawn: You have some high-maintenance animals. Norman: Not really. And, don't forget to change the cat litter daily, or he might have an accident on the carpet. [Oh, great.] And finally, there's Buttercup. Shawn: Buttercup? Who's Buttercu ...? I'm afraid to ask. Norman: Ah, she's a sweetie [What?] ... if you know how to handle her right. [Oh, great.] Wait. Let me get her for you. Here you are. Shawn: That's ... That's a snake ...[Hold her.] That's a big snake with big fangs. Does the snake go to a therapist, too? Norman: Of course not ... just an anger-management class. Shawn: Oh! What? Norman: I'm joking. Buttercup is a very docile creature, and she never bites anyone she likes. If she doesn't, you'll know because she starts hissing and staring at you ... kind like what she's doing now. Shawn: Well, I'm leaving. You must be going out of you mind to think I'm going to watch a zoo full of misunderstood animals. You'd better hire some professional help 'cause I wouldn't watch them even if you paid me a million dollars.             question:             What is Shawn's final response to Norman?             options:             A. Norman should seek someone who is well-trained with animals. B. Norman should take his animals to the zoo for special care. C. Norman agrees to watch them for a lot of extra money.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine Shawn's final response to Norman, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Introduction**: Norman asks Shawn to take care of his animals while he and his wife are out of town.
2. **Dog (Jaws)**: Shawn is reluctant to take care of Jaws, the dog, especially due to a past incident that injured his leg.
3. **Cat (Claws)**: Norman explains that Claws is a temperamental cat who requires classical music and visits a therapist. Shawn is surprised and seems overwhelmed by these unusual care requirements.
4. **Snake (Buttercup)**: Norman reveals that he has a snake named Buttercup, which unnerves Shawn even further.
After listening to the extensive care instructions and learning about the unusual nature of the animals, especially the snake, Shawn becomes increasingly overwhelmed and uncomfortable with the idea of taking care of them. In his final response, Shawn says:
"Well, I'm leaving. You must be going out of you mind to think I'm going to watch a zoo full of misunderstood animals. You'd better hire some professional help 'cause I wouldn't watch them even if you paid me a million dollars."
Based on this response, Shawn makes it clear that he refuses to take care of the animals and suggests that

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Norman should seek someone who is well-trained with animals.

Q: dialogue:             M: Excuse me, Madam. My fight is BA6520. Is this my gate? W: That's right. Please show your ticket and ID card.             question:             What is the man doing now?             options:             A. Paying money. B. Buying tickets. C. Checking in.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man is doing, we should analyze the dialogue step by step.
1. The man (M) is speaking to a woman (W), presumably an airline staff member.
2. He mentions that his flight is BA6520 and asks if he is at the correct gate.
3. The woman confirms that it is the correct gate and asks him to show his ticket and ID card.
Based on this interaction, the likely scenario is that the man is in the process of verifying his boarding information at the gate. He is neither purchasing tickets nor paying money, as these actions typically occur at different stages of the airport process.
The woman asking for the ticket and ID card is consistent with the process of checking in or verifying identity before boarding a flight. Therefore, the most suitable option is:
C. Checking in.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Checking in.

Q: dialogue:             W: Forgive my mess. We had a party last night. A lot of people came over and they all brought food and drinks. M: Yeah, I can tell. Well, I think it's pretty obvious what you'll be doing today.             question:             What will the woman probably do today?             options:             A. Ask her friends to come over. B. Get more food and drinks. C. Make a thorough cleaning.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman will probably do today, let's analyze the given dialogue and options step by step:
1. **Context Understanding**: The woman apologizes for the mess and explains that it was due to a party the previous night, where many people came over with food and drinks.
2. **Man's Comment**: The man responds by acknowledging the mess ("Yeah, I can tell") and suggests that it's obvious what the woman will be doing today.
3. **Inferring the Likely Action**: Given that there was a party and there's now a mess, it's reasonable to deduce that the main task the woman needs to tackle is cleaning up the party aftermath.
4. **Evaluating Options**:
   - **A. Ask her friends to come over**: While this could be a possibility, it's not directly related to addressing the current situation, which is the mess.
   - **B. Get more food and drinks**: This option seems unrelated to the immediate concern highlighted in the dialogue, which is the mess.
   - **C. Make a thorough cleaning**: This option directly addresses the situation mentioned, as cleaning up is the likely task after a party that resulted in a mess.
Given these points, the most logical and direct action the

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Make a thorough cleaning.

Q: dialogue:             M: Anne, please bring your passport with you and at least 2,000 dollars. W: I won't forget.             question:             What does the man ask Anne to do?             options:             A. He asks Anne to bring her passport and 2,000 dollars or more. B. He asks Anne to bring her passport and less than 2,000 dollars. C. He asks Anne to give him his passport and 2,000 dollars.
A: Let's think step by step.
The dialogue involves two people, M (the man) and W (Anne). The man makes a request to Anne. Let's analyze his request:
1. He explicitly asks Anne to bring two items:
   - Her passport
   - At least 2,000 dollars
2. The phrase "at least 2,000 dollars" specifies a minimum amount. This means Anne should bring 2,000 dollars or more.
Now, let's evaluate the provided options:
A. He asks Anne to bring her passport and 2,000 dollars or more.
   - This matches the man's request accurately because he asked for her passport and at least 2,000 dollars.
B. He asks Anne to bring her passport and less than 2,000 dollars.
   - This contradicts the man's request because he specified "at least" 2,000 dollars.
C. He asks Anne to give him his passport and 2,000 dollars.
   - This misrepresents the request. The man never mentioned having Anne give him anything; he only asked her to bring her passport and money.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option A: "He asks Anne to bring her passport and 2,000 dollars or more."

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. He asks Anne to bring her passport and 2,000 dollars or more.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the two speakers, W and M, are, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. **Flight Announcement**: W mentions that "Flight 331 is being announced." This clearly indicates that they are talking about a flight, which generally occurs at an airport.
2. **W's Statement**: The phrase "I'd better be on my way" suggests that W is preparing to leave or board the flight soon.
3. **Gratitude for Hospitality**: W thanks M for their "kind hospitality," which suggests that M hosted or helped W while they were in the area.
4. **M's Response**: M wishes W a "Happy landing," implying that W is about to fly somewhere. This is another strong indication that they are at a place where flights take off, which is an airport.
Considering all these points, the setting that makes the most sense is C. At the airport.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. At the airport.

They are both interested in music.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, "What do Laura and Kate have in common?" we need to look for clues in the dialogue that highlight any shared interests or experiences between them.
1. The dialogue mentions that Kate is visiting a friend named Laura whom she met at a music camp: "I'm visiting a friend I met last summer at the music camp. I shared a camp with Laura..."
   
2. Since they met at a music camp, it's clear that both Kate and Laura have an interest or involvement in music.
3. There's no mention in the dialogue that Laura knows Jack or that they both enjoy camping. The camping reference is specific to a music camp, not just camping for leisure.
Therefore, the most direct information given in the dialogue about what Kate and Laura have in common is that they are both interested in music.
The best answer is:
C. They are both interested in music.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. They are both interested in music.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the relationship between the speakers, we need to analyze the dialogue:
1. The person labeled "F" is expressing concern about the other person watching TV all day, specifically mentioning "The exam is coming!" This suggests a familial or caring relationship where one person is advising the other to focus on academics.
2. The person labeled "M" responds with "Don't worry, mum. I've got ready for it." This is a key part of the dialogue. The use of the term "mum" strongly indicates that this is a mother-son relationship, as "mum" is commonly used to refer to one's mother.
Based on this analysis, the most logical relationship between the two speakers is that they are mother and son.
Therefore, the answer is:
A. Mother and son.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Mother and son.

Q: dialogue:             M: I'm Paul Adams, Branch Manager. W: Katie Thomas. Pleased to meet you. M: I take it you're looking for temporary office work. W: That's right. M: How old are you, Katie? W: I'm eighteen. M: That's rather young. What experience have you had? W: Well, I've just left school, actually, and I'm looking for a job between now and when I go to college. M: It doesn't sound as though we can help, Katie. You see, our clients are very demanding, especially when it comes to the new office technology. W: Oh, that's no problem. I took extra classes in office skills at school. M: Oh, perhaps you'd like to outline what you've been doing? W: I started by learning keyboard skills. Then I went on to learn about word processing. M: Good. You seem qualified from the technical point of view.             question:             What can we learn about the woman?             options:             A. She just left college. B. She has been a branch manager. C. She just left middle school.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we can learn about the woman, Katie Thomas, let's carefully consider the dialogue:
1. **Age and Education Status**: Katie mentions that she is eighteen years old, and has "just left school" and is looking for a job "between now and when I go to college."
2. **Meaning of "Just Left School"**: In the context of an 18-year-old, "just left school" most likely means that she has completed high school or an equivalent level of education and hasn't yet started college. 
3. **Experience**: There's no indication in the dialogue that she has managed a branch or any operation, suggesting that option B is unlikely.
4. **Educational Timeline in Context**:
   - Option A ("She just left college.") is not correct as she mentions she is planning to go to college.
   - Option C ("She just left middle school.") doesn't fit the education system timelines for an 18-year-old since middle school typically finishes much earlier, around age 14 or 15.
Based on the logical interpretation of her age and educational status, we can conclude:
- Katie has just completed high school and is in preparation to attend college, but she hasn't left college because she hasn't attended yet.
- She also hasn't

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is none of the options accurately describe the situation based on the information in the dialogue. However, if confined strictly to the given options, the closest option, albeit incorrect

Q: dialogue:             M: Now some doctors are strongly encouraging arm exercises. W: Arm exercises? Is that because arms are too fat or too soft? M: Actually that's not the main reason. They say that arm exercises can make you physically healthy. W: But I was told that arm exercises could raise your blood pressure. M: Yes, but the article I read suggests some ways to make up for that. W: Really? How? M: By adding leg exercises, so that the arms don't do all the work. W: And in return, I'm sure that there's a good chance of losing weight. M: Sounds right to me. W: So what exercises do the experts suggest? M: They mentioned quite a few exercises, but one of the most popular ones is cycling. W: Good, I must try that.             question:             Why are some experts strongly encouraging arm exercises?             options:             A. Because our arms are often too fat. B. Because arm exercises can build up our health. C. Because our arms are often too soft.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the dialogue provided:
1. The W (Woman) asks M (Man) if arm exercises are encouraged because arms are too fat or too soft.
2. M responds by saying that the main reason is not because arms are too fat or too soft.
3. M mentions that the reason experts encourage arm exercises is that they can make you physically healthy.
4. The conversation continues about concerns like raising blood pressure and suggests pairing arm exercises with leg exercises for balance.
Given this information, the primary reason experts are recommending arm exercises is because they can contribute positively to physical health.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. Because arm exercises can build up our health.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Because arm exercises can build up our health.

Keep normal.
A: Let's think step by step.
From the dialogue, the woman (W) mentions that she was told arm exercises could raise blood pressure. Although the man (M) acknowledges this concern, he suggests that the article he read provided strategies to mitigate the issue, such as incorporating leg exercises to balance the workout. 
Therefore, within the context of the conversation, when focusing solely on arm exercises without any balancing activity like leg exercises, the implication is that blood pressure might increase. 
Thus, the answer is:
A. Increase.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Increase.

This part of the conversation indicates that leg exercises are recommended to balance or complement the arm exercises. 
Thus, the correct option to match the arm exercises is:
B. Leg exercises.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Leg exercises.

It was too dark there. C. It is not mentioned.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what caused the accident, let's first review the context provided in the dialogue between W and M. 
1. W mentions a news report indicating that a car hit a high building and asks if it is serious.
2. M responds by stating information from the police report, specifically that the driver is still alive.
The exchange between W and M does not provide any explicit information or details about what actually caused the accident. 
Now, let's analyze the options:
A. The driver was too careless.  
B. It was too dark there.  
C. It is not mentioned.  
Options A and B offer potential causes for the accident, but there is no information from the dialogue that supports either of these specific reasons. Therefore:
- Option A assumes the cause is driver carelessness, but this information is not provided.
- Option B assumes darkness as the cause, but this is also not mentioned.
Given that neither recklessness nor darkness is mentioned in the exchange, the most accurate choice is:
C. It is not mentioned.
Thus, the correct answer is C. It is not mentioned.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. It is not mentioned.

They left National Park late. C. The traffic was heavy on the road.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Tom arrived home late, let's break down the information provided in the dialogue:
1. **Setting:** Tom went to a picnic with Jim and Betty at National Park.
  
2. **Timeline and Activities:**
   - They left for the picnic in the morning, shortly after Jim and Betty arrived around 10 o'clock.
   - They spent the day engaging in various activities in the park, such as having lunch by the river, walking, and climbing a hill.
   - They went back to the car, drove to another part of the park for afternoon tea, and then started driving home afterwards.
3. **Travel and Traffic:**
   - Mary comments, "Oh, you left early!" implying they didn't stay too long.
   - Tom mentions, "But it took a long time to reach home because there was a lot of traffic on the road." This statement directly indicates that the heavy traffic was the reason for his late arrival.
Now, let's look at the options:
A. There's a traffic accident on the road.
   - The dialogue does not mention anything about an accident, so this option is not supported by the information given.
B. They left National Park late.
   - Mary actually notes they left early, so this option contradicts

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. The traffic was heavy on the road.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's break down the dialogue step by step:
1. **W: What's wrong with you?** 
   - The woman is asking the man what the problem is or what the issue is.
2. **M: I fell from the tree and hurt my leg.**
   - The man explains the situation. He says that he fell from a tree and, as a result, hurt his leg.
Now, let's examine the options in relation to the man's explanation:
- **A. He fell down and hurt his leg.**
  - This option directly matches the man's statement about falling from the tree and hurting his leg.
- **B. He hurt the tree.**
  - There is no mention of the man hurting the tree in the dialogue. This option does not match the information provided.
- **C. The tree fell.**
  - The dialogue does not mention the tree falling. The man says he fell from the tree, not that the tree itself fell.

Give a lecture. B. Go skating. C. Call her sister.
A: Let's think step by step.
1. M asks if W is free to go skating on Saturday evening, indicating an invitation or a suggestion to go skating.
2. W responds that she is free because the lecture she planned to attend with her sister was canceled.
3. Given the options:
   - A. Give a lecture: This is not supported by the dialogue, as W was planning to attend a lecture, not give one.
   - B. Go skating: Since W is now free and M's question implies an invitation, it is most likely that W will agree to go skating.
   - C. Call her sister: There is no indication in the dialogue that W plans to call her sister. Her availability was a result of the canceled plan.
Therefore, the most probable action for W on Saturday evening, based on the information given, is:
B. Go skating.

1. **The woman's statement**: She expresses a desire to buy a sweater in a specific shop. This indicates her interest in the shop's selection of sweaters.
2. **The man's response**: He says he has been to that shop before and doesn't think the styles suit her. This implies a few things:
   - He has experience with the shop, suggesting he is familiar with their selection.
   - He believes the style of the sweaters in the shop does not match her taste or preferences.
Now, let's evaluate the options in light of the man's response:
- **Option A: The sweaters are ugly.**
  - This is a possibility, but the man doesn't explicitly call the sweaters ugly. He only says the styles don't suit her, which doesn't necessarily mean the sweaters are ugly in general; they just might not match her style.
- **Option B: She can't buy a suitable sweater in that shop.**
  - This aligns well with the man's statement. He implies that based on her style or preference, she may not find a suitable sweater.
- **Option C: He has bought a sweater in that shop.**
  - While his familiarity with the shop suggests he may have

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. She can't buy a suitable sweater in that shop.

Q: dialogue:             W: Good morning, sir. Could I ask you to register, please? M: Certainly. What do I do? W: Just fill in this form, if you would, please.             question:             What is the most probable relationship of the two people?             options:             A. Doctor and patient. B. Receptionist and tourist. C. Salesperson and customer.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most probable relationship between the two people, we need to analyze the dialogue between them.
**Dialogue Analysis:**
- The woman, labeled as "W," greets the man, labeled as "M" with "Good morning, sir." This is a formal greeting, which could be used in various contexts.
- The woman asks the man to "register" and provides a form for him to fill out. These actions give us clues about their relationship.
**Options Analysis:**
- **A. Doctor and patient:** In a doctor-patient relationship, the doctor typically does not handle registration. Instead, a receptionist would usually handle this task in a medical office. Furthermore, the conversation does not contain any medical terminology or context that would specifically indicate a medical setting.
  
- **B. Receptionist and tourist:** A receptionist, especially in a hotel or similar establishment, would commonly ask someone to register by filling out a form. The formal greeting and request to register fit well with a setting where a receptionist is checking in a new guest or visitor, such as a tourist arriving at a hotel.
  
- **C. Salesperson and customer:** In a salesperson-customer interaction, it is uncommon for the salesperson to ask the customer to fill out a registration form at

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Receptionist and tourist.

M: Yes, it was one of his campaign promises and he's seriously trying to make it a reality.             question:             What can be learned about taxes from the conversation?             options:             A. Taxes will be lower. B. Taxes will increase. C. Taxes will be higher.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the dialogue between W and M. 
1. **W's Statement**: W mentions that they have heard about the mayor planning a tax reduction and asks M for details. 
2. **M's Response**: M confirms that the mayor is indeed trying to implement a tax reduction, which was one of his campaign promises.
Based on this exchange, we can deduce that the focus is on a reduction in taxes. There is no mention of an increase or a situation where taxes would be higher. 
Therefore, the information that can be learned from the conversation is that taxes are expected to be lower.
The correct option is: 
A. Taxes will be lower.

At lunch, host Mr. Turner from the MG Company. Nothing special in the afternoon and evening. You can have a good rest. M: Mmm, not bad. W: But the day after tomorrow you'll have a busy day. Visit the products exhibition in the morning, have a quick lunch, and attend your management classes at 1:30 through to 5:00. Don't forget the party at the Century Palace at 6:00. The whole of your family are going. M: What a day!             question:             What is the relationship between the two speakers?             options:             A. Husband and wife. B. Manager and customer. C. Boss and secretary.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the relationship between the two speakers, we should analyze the dialogue and context:
1. **Content of Discussion**: The conversation is about the schedule of the male speaker (M). The female speaker (W) provides detailed information about various meetings, a lunch appointment, a management class, and a family party. This implies a structured professional and personal interest in his schedule.
2. **Detail Orientation**: The female speaker, W, has comprehensive knowledge about the male speaker's professional meetings and even personal engagements like the family party. This level of detail suggests a formal and supportive role concerning the male speaker's activities.
3. **Language and Tone**: The language used is straightforward and focused on planning and organization. There's no indication of informal or intimate language that might be expected in a personal relationship outside of work.
4. **Role Dynamics**: The male speaker relaxes when he hears there's nothing special in the afternoon and evening of the first day, and his reaction to the busier second day ("What a day!") suggests he relies on her scheduling. In professional settings, such reliance often indicates a role like a secretary who is responsible for managing schedules.
Considering these points, the most likely relationship is option C: Boss and secretary. The female speaker is likely acting

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Boss and secretary.

It is small. C. It is doing well.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we know about the man's company, we can analyze the dialogue for any clues regarding its status or performance.
The dialogue mentions several activities related to the man's work:
1. **Meeting with Managers:** He is scheduled to meet managers from four different departments. This suggests that the company is structured and likely has multiple departments, which might indicate a larger or well-organized company. This could imply the company is performing well enough to maintain such a structure.
2. **Hosting Mr. Turner:** The man is hosting someone from the MG Company. Hosting external individuals, like a representative from another company, can indicate networking or business development activities, which are generally positive signs.
3. **Product Exhibition:** The man is visiting a products exhibition. Participation in exhibitions can be a sign that the company is active in promoting its products, which again might imply good performance.
4. **Management Classes:** Continuing education, such as attending management classes, suggests investment in skills and leadership, which is generally indicative of a company doing well.
5. **Family Party:** The mention of a family party at the Century Palace suggests the possibility of a work-life balance, which might imply successful management and potentially a prosperous state of business affairs.
From these observations, there are no explicit signs of trouble or

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. It is doing well.

A: Let's think step by step.
The conversation is about the man seeking information regarding trips to Paris. The woman provides detailed information about the trip, like the travel method, number of people usually in a group, departure and return location, items to bring, necessary advance booking time, costs, and she invites the man to discuss the details further in person.
Given this context, let's analyze the options:
A. A traveler: While both the man and woman are discussing a travel trip, the woman is actively providing information and not seeking information. This makes it unlikely that she is a traveler alongside the man. 
B. A friend of the man: There is no indication of personal familiarity in their conversation. It is formal and centered on providing service-related information without personal anecdotes or familiarity one might expect from friends.
C. A travel agent: The woman provides detailed information regarding a travel itinerary, costs, booking requirements, and even details about space limitations, which are typically details that a travel agent would provide to a prospective traveler.
Based on the nature of their conversation, the most logical conclusion is that the woman is:
C. A travel agent.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how the man feels about what the woman said, we need to analyze the dialogue.
1. The woman says, "There you are! I've been looking for you everywhere." This indicates that the woman has been actively searching for the man and possibly thought he was somewhere else or had difficulty finding him.
2. The man's response, "Everywhere? Why? We've been right here all along. At least, I have," suggests a reaction to the woman's statement. He questions her claim of looking "everywhere," which implies a sense of incredulity or mild disbelief. 
3. The tone of the man's response likely indicates that he is reacting to the situation with an emotion. Let's evaluate the options:
   - A. Frightened: There is no indication of fear or concern in the man's response. He is questioning her statement rather than expressing fear.
   
   - B. Surprised: The man's questioning of "Everywhere?" combined with "We've been right here all along" suggests he is surprised by the woman's claim. He seems to find it unexpected or puzzling that she couldn't find him when he was in the same place.

Q: dialogue:             W: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning. M: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him. W: About what time would you think that they were there? M: Just after half past one to a quarter past two. W: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes. M: In fact, yes, as short as that. W: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club? M: Fifty meters. W: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time? M: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well. W: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them. M: No, not at this stage. W: Well, thank you very much.             question:             How old is the man murdered?             options:             A. In his twenties. B. In his forties. C. In his thirties.

We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well. W: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them. M: No, not at this stage. W: Well, thank you very much.             question:             Where was the body found?             options:             A. In a drinking club. B. In the London underground. C. In the underpass of a certain road.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question "Where was the body found?" we need to examine the dialogue for clues about the location.
1. The dialogue discusses the death of a man in North London and the investigation led by Detective Chief Superintendent John Day.
2. M (Detective Day) states: "He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road."
3. W clarifies their understanding: "And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?" This question further confirms that the location where the body was found is an underpass.
Based on the information above, the body was found in the underpass of a certain road, namely the North Circular Road.
Therefore, the correct option is:
C. In the underpass of a certain road.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. In the underpass of a certain road.

Q: dialogue:             W: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning. M: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him. W: About what time would you think that they were there? M: Just after half past one to a quarter past two. W: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes. M: In fact, yes, as short as that. W: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club? M: Fifty meters. W: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time? M: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well. W: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them. M: No, not at this stage. W: Well, thank you very much.             question:             Who is the murderer?             options:             A. Not known yet. B. A minicab driver. C. Two women.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine who the murderer is, let's go through the information provided in the dialogue step by step:
1. **Discovery of the Victim**: A man in his forties was found dead in a pedestrian subway in Neasden with multiple head injuries. 
2. **Timeline and Location**:
   - The man left the Level One Club around 1:30 a.m.
   - He was found at approximately 2:15 a.m., which gives a 45-minute window for the crime to occur.
   - The club is located 50 meters from the pedestrian underpass where his body was discovered.
3. **Potential Witnesses**:
   - There may have been two girls and a drunk man near the entrance to the subway who could have seen the victim or the attacker.
   - It's mentioned that minicab drivers might have been in the area and could provide information if they saw anything.
4. **Current Investigative Status**:
   - The police are treating the case as a murder investigation.
   - They are seeking information from any witnesses including the two mentioned girls, the drunken man, and potentially the minicab drivers.
   - They have not yet identified any suspects or witnesses who can definitively point to the murderer.
Given the information presented

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Not known yet.

Q: dialogue:             M: Do you want to turn on the air conditioner or open the window? W: I love fresh air if you don't mind.             question:             What can be inferred from the woman's answer?             options:             A. She likes to have the air conditioner on. B. She'd like to have the windows open. C. The air is heavily polluted.
A: Let's think step by step.
To infer from the woman's answer, let's analyze her response: "I love fresh air if you don't mind."
1. **Understanding the response:**
   - The woman expresses her preference for "fresh air."
2. **Context of the dialogue:**
   - M offers two options: turning on the air conditioner or opening the window.
3. **Interpretation:**
   - By stating "I love fresh air," the woman is implicitly choosing the option that provides fresh air.
   - Opening the window is typically associated with getting fresh air, whereas an air conditioner recirculates room air and conditions it to a desired temperature.
4. **Evaluating options:**
   - Option A ("She likes to have the air conditioner on"): This doesn't align with her preference for fresh air.
   - Option B ("She'd like to have the windows open"): This aligns with her preference for fresh air, as opening the window would allow fresh air to come in.
   - Option C ("The air is heavily polluted"): There's no indication or discussion in the dialogue about air pollution.
Based on this analysis, the correct inference is option B: She'd like to have the windows open.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. She'd like to have the windows open.

Q: dialogue:             M: It's a vicious circle, really. It takes me the best part of an hour to get here in the morning, so I honestly never have time for breakfast. W: But you should always have something. According to nutrition experts, it's the most important meal of the day. M: That's a load of rubbish, if you ask me. It's all very well for them. They've probably got time for it. I haven't. Anyway, when I get to work, I'm plunged into the usual stressful day, and my hunger just sort of evaporates. W: Yes. I only live around the corner, but I often skip breakfast myself, but I suppose you could always make up for it at the lunch time. M: I should, but more often than not I just grab a cup of coffee and a few biscuits, or a sandwich. W: There's nothing wrong with that. That's all I ever have when I'm busy. M: Fine, but what happens as the day wears on is that the less you eat, the less you want to eat. Abstinence seems to suppress the appetite, somehow. W: Well, I suspect what we ought to be doing is establishing a regular pattern of eating, instead of just grabbing what we can when we can. M: Em, a sensible conventional diet. There's no doubt that's the way to go, so shall we now go and do something for a change? You name the restaurant and I'll treat you to lunch. W: That will be nice.             question:             How long does it take the man to get to work every morning?             options:             A. Nearly an hour B. More than an hour C. Half an hour
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how long it takes the man to get to work every morning, we need to focus on what he says in the dialogue. The man, M, states: "It takes me the best part of an hour to get here in the morning."
Let's break this down:
1. The phrase "the best part of" typically means "almost" or "nearly." It's often used to indicate that something is close to the given amount, but possibly just slightly under.
2. Therefore, when M says "the best part of an hour," he is indicating that it takes him nearly an hour to get to work.
Based on this understanding, let's evaluate the options:
- Option A: Nearly an hour – This seems to match the interpretation of "the best part of an hour."
- Option B: More than an hour – This would not align with "the best part of an hour," as this phrase suggests it is close to, but not over, an hour.
- Option C: Half an hour – This is significantly shorter than what "the best part of an hour" would imply.
Consequently, the correct option is:
A. Nearly an hour

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Nearly an hour

He's not hungry in the mornings. C. He doesn't have time for it.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the man skips breakfast, let's examine the dialogue:
1. The man (M) mentions that it takes him the best part of an hour to get to work in the morning, which leads him to say, "I honestly never have time for breakfast." This indicates a lack of time in the morning is a significant reason for skipping breakfast.
2. Although he dismisses the nutrition experts' advice as "rubbish," this dismissal is more about his skepticism towards the importance of breakfast rather than a reason for skipping it.
3. The man states that when he arrives at work and is plunged into a stressful day, his hunger "just sort of evaporates," which implies he might not feel hungry after starting his workday. However, this is more about his appetite at work rather than skipping breakfast first thing in the morning.
Considering these points, the primary reason the man skips breakfast is because he doesn't have enough time for it due to his morning commute. 
Therefore, the correct option is:
C. He doesn't have time for it.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He doesn't have time for it.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman suggests the man do, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. The conversation starts with the man explaining that he doesn't have time for breakfast due to a long commute.
2. The woman emphasizes the importance of breakfast but acknowledges that she also often skips it.
3. She suggests that the man could make up for missing breakfast at lunchtime: "but I suppose you could always make up for it at the lunch time."
Given this analysis, the woman's suggestion is most directly related to option B: "Eat more at lunch time." 
The other options, A ("Plan his time better") and C ("Have a sandwich upon arrival at work"), were not mentioned or implied as direct suggestions by the woman.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Eat more at lunch time.

Grab something to eat together
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the speakers decide to do, let's analyze their conversation step by step:
1. The conversation starts with M describing how their morning routine prevents them from having breakfast. W agrees to some extent and mentions that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, according to experts.
2. M expresses skepticism about the necessity of breakfast and describes how a stressful day at work diminishes their hunger.
3. W shares that they often skip breakfast too but suggests that making up for it at lunchtime is possible.
4. M and W discuss their typical lunchtime habits, which are not very substantial, implying they're both guilty of not having proper meals.
5. W suggests establishing a regular eating pattern instead of just grabbing food when possible.
6. In response, M agrees that a sensible conventional diet is important but then shifts the conversation to suggesting "shall we now go and do something for a change?" and offers, "You name the restaurant and I'll treat you to lunch."
7. W responds with acceptance of the offer, "That will be nice."
Considering these points, the final part of their conversation reveals that M is suggesting going to a restaurant and treating W to lunch. The dialogue indicates a shift from their usual routine to treat themselves to a proper meal instead.
Therefore, the

W: I plan to get there around 8:30. M: OK. See you then. W: See you. Goodbye.             question:             When does the woman plan to get to the station?             options:             A. Around 8:30 a.m. B. Around 6 p.m. C. Around 8:30 p. m.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question of when the woman plans to get to the station, we need to look at the specific part of the dialogue where the woman mentions her arrival time.
The relevant part of the dialogue is:
- M: "What time do you plan to arrive at the station?"
- W: "I plan to get there around 8:30."
Since invitations to birthday parties typically suggest events that occur later in the day, and given the context of an 8:30 arrival time without an "a.m." or "p.m." specified, the logical inference is that this is an evening activity.
It is therefore most reasonable to interpret her arrival time as 8:30 p.m.
Thus, the correct option is:
C. Around 8:30 p.m.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Around 8:30 p.m.

B. $ 130. C. $ 140.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the total cost for one month including electricity, we need to look at what W mentioned in the dialogue.
W mentioned two different pricing structures:
1. Weekly rate: $30 for rent + $10 for electricity = $40 per week.
2. Monthly rate: $130 total (including electricity).
Since the question asks for the cost for one month including electricity, we should use the monthly rate provided.
Therefore, the correct answer is option B: $130.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. $130.

The man no longer smokes. C. The man is under pressure from his wife.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we can learn from the conversation, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. W: "So you've finally listened to your wife's advice and given up smoking?"
   - This statement suggests that the man's wife has advised him to quit smoking.
2. M: "It was my doctor's advice. I'm suffering from high blood pressure."
   - The man clarifies that he quit smoking because of his doctor's advice, not necessarily due to his wife's suggestion. He also reveals that he has high blood pressure, which influenced his decision.
Now, let's evaluate the options provided:
A. The man usually follows his wife's advice.
   - The dialogue does not provide evidence that the man usually follows his wife's advice. In fact, he specifies that it was the doctor's advice that led to his decision.
B. The man no longer smokes.
   - Implicit in the conversation is the understanding that the man has "given up smoking," as mentioned by W, and not contradicted by M. Therefore, this is a reasonable deduction.
C. The man is under pressure from his wife.
   - The dialogue does not indicate that the man is under pressure from his wife. The reason he gives for quitting smoking is related to his health and his doctor’s advice.

Fly to another city together with her uncle. C. Say good-bye to her uncle at the airport.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman will do this evening, we need to analyze the dialogue:
1. **M's Question**: M asks if they shall play basketball tonight.
2. **W's Response**: W apologizes and says she can't play basketball because she has a prior commitment.
3. **Reason Given**: W states she is "seeing [her] uncle off at the airport at 7:30."
Now, let's consider the options:
- **Option A**: "Meet her uncle at the airport." - This could imply she is going to greet him upon arrival, but she specifically mentions "seeing off," which suggests something different.
- **Option B**: "Fly to another city together with her uncle." - This doesn't fit the context provided. "Seeing off" usually implies saying goodbye to someone who is leaving, not accompanying them.
- **Option C**: "Say good-bye to her uncle at the airport." - "Seeing off" is a common phrase used when saying goodbye to someone who is departing, usually at a travel location like an airport.
Therefore, the most logical interpretation of the phrase "seeing my uncle off" aligns with Option C. She will be saying goodbye to her uncle as he departs.
The answer is

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is Option C: Say good-bye to her uncle at the airport.

Let me give you some more chicken. There's plenty more. M: No, thanks. I'm full I'd like a cup of tea, please. W: Ok. Here you are. M: Thank you. What a delicious supper!             question:             What can be seen at their supper table?             options:             A. Fried chickens, sandwiches and tea. B. Some chicken. C. Sandwiches with chicken.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what can be seen at their supper table, let's examine the dialogue carefully:
1. W offers another piece of chicken to M, implying that there is fried chicken on the table.
2. M confirms enjoying the chicken and asks about sandwiches, indicating that sandwiches are likely present.
3. The dialogue explicitly mentions "sandwiches" multiple times, suggesting their presence on the table.
4. W confirms purchasing KFC in Qianmen and sandwiches from a Kentucky Restaurant, which means both fried chicken and sandwiches are available.
5. At the end of the conversation, M requests a cup of tea, and W provides it, confirming that tea is also part of the supper.
Based on the dialogue, the supper table likely includes fried chicken, sandwiches, and tea. Thus, the correct option is:
A. Fried chickens, sandwiches and tea.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Fried chickens, sandwiches and tea.

She doesn't agree with the man.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the woman's attitude, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Understanding the Man's Position**: 
   - The man clearly expresses a negative opinion, saying, "I believe that choosing this man will be a complete mistake." This indicates that he is against the idea of choosing this particular individual.
2. **Understanding the Woman's Response**:
   - The woman responds with, "I wouldn't look at it like that." This suggests that she has a different perspective on the situation. 
3. **Interpreting the Woman's Attitude**:
   - The phrase "I wouldn't look at it like that" indicates that the woman disagrees with the man's assessment. She is suggesting that the situation or choice may not be as negative as the man perceives it to be.
Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the woman's attitude is represented by option C: She doesn't agree with the man.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. She doesn't agree with the man.

Q: dialogue:             W: Are you coming with me to the history museum, Godge? M: I already have my hands full with this book report.             question:             What does the man mean?             options:             A. He has to read a history book. B. He has already visited the museum. C. He is too busy to go with her.
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand the man's response, we need to interpret the context of the dialogue.
1. **Identify the characters**: 
   - W (the woman) asks Godge if he wants to come to the history museum.
   - M (the man), presumably Godge, responds that he already has his hands full with a book report.
2. **Analyze the man's statement**:
   - The phrase "I already have my hands full" generally means that someone is very busy or has too much to do.
   - The book report is mentioned as the task occupying his time, suggesting it demands a lot of his attention.
3. **Determine the underlying meaning of the man's response**:
   - The man's focus on his book report indicates that he cannot take on additional activities at the moment.
   - Therefore, the man is implying that he is too busy to accompany the woman to the museum due to his commitment to completing the book report.
4. **Compare with the answer choices**:
   - A. "He has to read a history book." This option is not directly supported as the book's subject isn't specified.
   - B. "He has already visited the museum." This option doesn't correlate with his excuse about being busy with a book report.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He is too busy to go with her.

Q: dialogue:             M: How are the restaurant prices here? W: Oh. It's not cheap but not very expensive. You can have a nice lunch for about $6.30.             question:             What does the woman think of the restaurant prices here?             options:             A. Fair. B. Cheap. C. Expensive.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman thinks of the restaurant prices, we need to analyze her response in the dialogue.
1. The man asks about how the restaurant prices are.
2. The woman responds by saying, "It's not cheap but not very expensive."
Let's break down her statement:
- "Not cheap" indicates that the prices are not low, meaning they are higher than what one would consider cheap.
- "Not very expensive" indicates that while the prices are not cheap, they are also not on the high end.
The woman's response suggests that the prices are moderate—neither too low nor too high. Therefore, the woman's opinion aligns best with the option that indicates a moderate or reasonable price level.
Considering the options provided:
A. Fair. B. Cheap. C. Expensive.
The most fitting interpretation of "not cheap but not very expensive" is that the prices are fair.
Therefore, the answer is:
A. Fair.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Fair.

Q: dialogue:             M: We'll be here in London staying in a newspaper office or teaching in a classroom full of chalk dust. W: Well, Tom, you'd be able to go out in the sunshine sometimes. You are a journalist. I am the one who has to stay in the classroom. Remember.             question:             What is the woman's profession?             options:             A. Journalist. B. Editor. C. Teacher.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the woman's profession, we can closely examine the dialogue:
1. M mentions two professions: staying in a newspaper office and teaching in a classroom full of chalk dust.
2. W responds by addressing M as "Tom" and suggests he could go out in the sunshine sometimes because he is a journalist.
3. Crucially, W then states, "I am the one who has to stay in the classroom," which indicates she is referring to one of the professions mentioned by M.
From the participation of M and W in the conversation:
- M is implied to be a journalist based on W's remark about him being able to go out in the sunshine.
- W mentions staying in the classroom, which aligns with the teaching profession mentioned by M.
Therefore, the woman's profession is revealed to be teaching.
The answer is:
C. Teacher.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Teacher.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how many jobs the man has had, we need to focus closely on the information provided in the dialogue.
1. The dialogue states: "M: I just got my first job offer." 
2. The use of "first job offer" implies that the man has not had any job offers before this one.
3. This is his first job offer, indicating that he has not held any jobs previously.
Based on this reasoning, the man has had no jobs before receiving this first offer. Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. One

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. One

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the right answer, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. **F: Excuse me. I didn't hear what you said.**
   - The woman indicates that she did not hear what the man said initially.
2. **M: I asked if you could lend me your bike.**
   - The man repeats his question, which is asking if the woman could lend her bike to him.
Next, let's evaluate each option:
- **Option A: The woman has a bike.**
  - Since the man asked the woman to lend him "your bike," it implies that the woman likely has one. This is a reasonable inference, given the direct language used by M.
- **Option B: The man has a bike.**
  - There is no information in the dialogue to suggest that the man has a bike. He is asking to borrow one, which typically implies he doesn't have one available at the moment.
- **Option C: The woman won't lend her bike.**
  - The dialogue does not provide any information about the woman's response to lending the bike, so we can't conclude that she won't lend it.
Given these evaluations, the most accurate choice is **Option A: The woman has a bike.**

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is Option A: The woman has a bike.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman will do later this evening, we need to pay attention to the dialogue between M and W. The woman states, "I have to prepare for tomorrow's history test." This directly indicates her plans for the evening.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. She will prepare for her maths test. - This option is incorrect because the woman mentioned she is preparing for a history test, not a maths test.
B. She will prepare for her English test. - This option is incorrect because the woman mentioned she is preparing for a history test, not an English test.
C. She will prepare for her history test. - This option is correct because it matches exactly what the woman said she will be doing.
Therefore, the correct answer is: C. She will prepare for her history test.

Brush up on her French. C. Study the map of Quebec Province.
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Initial Discussion:**
   - Shelly mentions she is going to visit the province of Quebec.
   - She asks if Montreal is the capital city and learns that Quebec City is actually the capital.
2. **Language Consideration:**
   - Shelly expresses concern about her ability to communicate using French in Montreal.
   - She mentions her French is okay, but not very good.
3. **Advice from the Man:**
   - The man confirms people speak both French and English in Montreal but emphasizes that you'll hear French most of the time.
   - He also mentions that all street signs are in French.
Based on this, the logical advice given by the man is to address Shelly's concern about the French language, concluding with:  
**B. Brush up on her French.**
This advice directly relates to her concern about language barriers during her trip.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Brush up on her French.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man says about Quebec City, let's carefully review the dialogue:
1. **Context**: The dialogue involves Shelly discussing her upcoming trip to Quebec, where she'll attend a wedding in Montreal and do some sightseeing in Quebec City.
2. **Relevant Dialogue for Quebec City**: 
   - The woman, Shelly, asks the man about Quebec City.

W: Just two. I'll carry the other one with me. M: That's good. We can check in two anyway. Give your baggage ticket to the driver when you get to New York W: Okay, thanks a lot. M: You're welcome. Have a good trip.             question:             Where does this conversation take place?             options:             A. At an airport. B. At a railway station. C. At a coach station.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the location where this conversation is taking place, we should consider the details given in the dialogue itself.
1. **Type of Ticket**: The conversation is about purchasing a ticket to New York. While planes, trains, and coaches can all travel to New York, the mention of a "coach" indicates we are dealing with a bus service. The word "coach" is particularly important here as it is typically associated with buses.
2. **Price of Ticket**: The ticket price mentioned is $55 for a one-way trip. This is relatively low compared to air or even some train fares, again suggesting a coach/bus service rather than an airport or train station.
3. **Departure Time and Location**: The departure is stated to be at "2:15 at Gate 11," with the instruction to be at "door by 2:00." While gates and doors can be used in both airports and bus stations, the context of a coach further supports a bus station scenario.
4. **Luggage Policy**: There is a discussion about checking in bags and carrying one. While all three types of transport (plane, train, and bus) have luggage guidelines, the style of dialogue about checking in two suitcases is quite common in bus travel

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. At a coach station.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we learn about the woman from the dialogue, let's analyze the provided conversation:
1. **Previous Trip Experience**: The woman mentions, "Last time I took this coach it was only 50," which indicates that she has taken this trip before. This aligns with option A: "She has taken this trip before."
2. **Ticket Type**: The woman specifically requests a one-way ticket by saying, "No, one way," when asked if it's a round trip. This suggests that option B: "She has bought a return ticket," is incorrect.
3. **Suitcase Information**: During the conversation, the woman says, "Just two. I'll carry the other one with me," when asked about checking in suitcases. There is no mention of a lost suitcase, so option C: "She has lost one suitcase," is not supported by the dialogue.
Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
A. She has taken this trip before.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. She has taken this trip before.

Q: dialogue:             M: Hi, Ann. I hear you've started evening discussions on popular music. How is it going? W: Pretty well. I must say I've learned a lot. But it would be nicer to have someone who knows more about the subject. Could you possibly join us? M: Certainly. When do you usually meet? W: We meet twice a week-Tuesday and Saturday. Is the time convenient for you? M: Tuesday is OK. But I don't think I can come on Saturday. W: What about Friday evenings? We hope to see you present. M: OK. I'm free on Friday evenings.             question:             Why does the woman invite the man to attend the discussion?             options:             A. Because he knows a lot about pop music. B. Because he is free most of the time. C. Because he is easy to get along with.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to analyze the dialogue carefully, focusing on why the woman invites the man to attend the discussion.
1. **Understanding the Initial Context**: The dialogue starts with M asking W about her evening discussions on popular music. W says they are going pretty well and mentions that she has learned a lot.
2. **Reason for Invitation**: W expresses a desire for someone who knows more about the subject to join the discussions. She asks M if he can join them, indicating she believes he has valuable knowledge about popular music.
3. **Confirmation and Scheduling**: M confirms his willingness to join and discusses suitable times, resulting in an agreement for him to join on Fridays.
Now, let's consider the options given for the question:
- **Option A**: Because he knows a lot about pop music.
- **Option B**: Because he is free most of the time.
- **Option C**: Because he is easy to get along with.
From the dialogue, W clearly indicates that she would like someone who knows more about popular music, which fits Option A. There is no evidence in the dialogue that the invitation is due to his availability (Option B) or his interpersonal skills (Option C).
Therefore, the correct answer is **Option

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Because he knows a lot about pop music.

Now, let's match the explanation to the options provided:
- **Option A** ("They're very bright"): While the woman's comment implies that the shoes might be colorful, the man does not directly say anything about their brightness.
- **Option B** ("They keep you from falling down"): The man does not mention that the shoes are designed to prevent falling; rather, he describes how they facilitate "sliding on the floor."
- **Option C** ("They're for bowling"): The man explicitly states that they are "bowling shoes" and describes their purpose within the context of bowling.
From this analysis, the best answer is **C. They're for bowling**.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. They're for bowling.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the reason for the drop in box office sales, we should analyze the dialogue carefully:
1. **W's Question:** W asks why movie box office sales have been down this summer.
2. **M's Response:** M mentions several reasons:
   - People have more choices about how to spend their leisure time.
   - The DVD business impacts movie-going.
   - There is a need for better quality and more entertaining films.
3. **Analysis of Provided Options:**
   - **Option A (There are too few new films produced a year):** The dialogue doesn't suggest that a lack of new films is causing the drop.
   - **Option B (Audiences are bored with films of a similar theme):** While M mentions a need for better quality and entertaining films, boredom with similar themes is not explicitly mentioned.
   - **Option C (People now have more spare time choices):** M explicitly states that "Now they have more choices about how to spend their leisure time," which matches this option.
Given this analysis, the most directly supported reason for the drop in the box office sales, based on the dialogue, is **Option C: People now have more spare time choices.**

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. People now have more spare time choices.

Q: dialogue:             R: Good evening, sir. Can I help you? M: Yes. I think I left my digital camera on the train from London earlier today. R: Did you, sir? Oh, well, in that case, we'd better fill in a Lost Property Form. Can you tell me your name? M: Yes, it's Mark Adams. R: OK. Your address? M: You mean in Britain or in the States? R: How long are you staying? M: Oh, I've still got a few months in Britain. R: OK, then can you give me your address here? M: Right. It's 18 Linden Drive, Laten Essex. Do you want the phone number? R: Yes, I'd better have that too. M: OK, 0809 45233. R: Thanks. And you say it was a digital camera, what make and model? M: It's Samsung G302. R: OK, got that. Now, you say it was the London train. What time did it arrive in Edinburgh? M: At 4:45 this afternoon. R: Well then, if we find it, sir, shall we phone you or write to you?

A: Let's think step by step.
In the given dialogue between R (presumably a railway staff member) and M (Mark Adams), M is reporting a lost digital camera on a train and providing details required to fill out a Lost Property Form. 
Let's examine the information that R asks M for:
1. Name: R asks for M's name, and M provides it as "Mark Adams." This means the name is needed for the form.
2. Address: R asks for M's address in Britain, and M provides it ("18 Linden Drive, Laten Essex"). This implies the address is needed for the form.
3. Phone Number: R requests the phone number, and M gives it as "0809 45233." Although this is not explicitly listed in the options, it is often part of contact information similar to an address, and thus typically necessary.
R does not ask for or mention anything about M's nationality during this interaction. The details requested are name, address, phone number, the object lost (a digital camera), its make and model, time of the train arrival, and M's preference for being contacted about the lost item.
Thus, of the given options, the detail that is NOT needed for the Lost Property Form, as evidenced by this conversation, is:

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where Mark Adams comes from, let's analyze the information given in the dialogue. 
1. **Name**: Mark Adams
2. **Lost Item**: Digital Camera
3. **Travel Information**: Mark left his camera on a train from London.
4. **Address**: 
   - Mark asks if the address required is his address in Britain or in the States, suggesting he has a connection to both places.
   - He provides an address in Britain: 18 Linden Drive, Laten Essex.
5. **Further Information**:
   - When asked how long he is staying, he mentions he still has a few months in Britain, indicating he is not permanently residing there.
   
From the above points:
- Mark has an address in Essex, a part of Britain.
- He queries whether the required address is for Britain or the States, indicating he's likely from the United States and is temporarily residing in Britain.
Consequently, the correct interpretation is that Mark Adams comes from the United States. Thus, the answer is:

To wait for the phone call
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what Mark Adams will do the day after tomorrow, let's review the dialogue carefully:
1. Mark Adams has misplaced his digital camera on the train from London and is filling out a Lost Property Form with the railway employee (R).
2. After providing his personal information and details about the digital camera, the employee asks if they should phone or write to Mark if the camera is found.
3. Mark responds, "No. I think I will drop in the day after tomorrow to check out."
From Mark's response, it is clear that he intends to visit the office in person. 
Now, let's examine the options:
A. To call the office
B. To come to the office again
C. To wait for the phone call
Option B aligns with Mark's stated intention to "drop in" to the office to check for the camera.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. To come to the office again.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. To come to the office again.

Telephone Mary.
A: Let's think step by step.
To solve this question, let's analyze the dialogue and the options.
1. **Dialogue Analysis:**
   - The conversation is between M (Man, Peter) and W (Woman, Jane).
   - Peter expresses his desire to know something about Mary and asks Jane how he can get in touch with her.
   - Jane provides Peter with a telephone number.
2. **Understanding the Context:**
   - Peter's main goal is to contact Mary.
   - Jane's response indicates that the telephone number is a means to reach Mary.
3. **Options Analysis:**
   - **Option A: Write Mary a letter.** 
     - There's no mention of a postal address or any discussion of writing a letter, so this option is unlikely.
   - **Option B: Go and see Mary.**
     - No mention of a physical address or the possibility of visiting Mary, making this option less likely.
   - **Option C: Telephone Mary.**
     - Jane specifically provides a telephone number for contacting Mary, making this the most logical and immediate action for Peter to take.
Based on the dialogue and the information given, the most probable action the man will take is:
**C. Telephone Mary.**

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is **C. Telephone Mary.**

Q: dialogue:             M: I think I'm going to give up playing tennis. I lost again today. W: Just because you lost? It that the reason to quit?             question:             What does the woman imply?             options:             A. The man should stop playing tennis. B. The man should stick to what he's doing. C. The man should take up a new hobby.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman implies, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Statement by M**: The man expresses his frustration by saying, "I think I'm going to give up playing tennis. I lost again today."
   - This indicates that the man is considering quitting tennis because of his repeated losses.
2. **Response by W**: The woman responds with, "Just because you lost? Is that the reason to quit?"
   - The woman's response suggests that she doesn't agree with the man's decision to quit based solely on losing. It implies that she may believe losing isn't a sufficient reason to stop playing tennis.
3. **Interpretation**: The woman's response questions the man's logic of quitting because of losing. By questioning it, she implies that losing should not be a reason to give up, and perhaps he should continue playing despite the losses.
Now, let's compare this interpretation to the options provided:
A. The man should stop playing tennis.
   - This does not align with the woman's implication since she questions his reason for quitting.
B. The man should stick to what he's doing.
   - This aligns with the implication as the woman suggests that losing isn't a good reason to quit, indicating he should continue playing.
C. The man should take up

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. The man should stick to what he's doing.

Q: dialogue:             M: Oh, no, it's Monday again. I always feel tired on Mondays. W: Oh, yeah. What did you do last night? M: Party at Lisa's. W: How interesting. How many people were there? M: Seventeen including Lisa herself. What did you do last night? W: I watched Gone with the Wind. M: Really? I didn't know it's playing again. W: It isn't. My brother has a tape and he brought it over, so we watched it at home.             question:             How many people were invited to the party at Lisa's home?             options:             A. Twenty. B. Seventeen. C. Sixteen.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how many people were invited to the party at Lisa's home, let's analyze the dialogue given:
- M mentions, "Party at Lisa's."
- W asks, "How many people were there?"
- M responds, "Seventeen including Lisa herself."
From M's response, we know that there were a total of seventeen people present at the party, including Lisa. 
The question asks how many people were invited to the party. While we know the total number of attendees, we don't have specific information about whether all of them were invited (in some cases, people might bring guests who weren't specifically invited themselves). However, the dialogue suggests that seventeen was the intended number of attendees since it's given as the number of people who were there.
Given this context, the best assumption is that the number of people present (seventeen) equals the number of people invited, as the number isn't described as being unexpected or as having extra attendees.
Thus, the closest answer to the question "How many people were invited to the party at Lisa's home?" is:
B. Seventeen.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Seventeen.

Q: dialogue:             M: Why didn't you make a birthday cake for Peter? W: Because I didn't have enough butter and you weren't here to buy any. I really had my hands full.             question:             Why didn't the woman make a cake?             options:             A. She was very busy. B. She was very angry with the man. C. She hurt her hands.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the woman didn't make a cake, let's review the dialogue:
1. The woman mentions that she "didn't have enough butter."
2. She also says to the man, "you weren't here to buy any."
3. She adds, "I really had my hands full."
From this information, we can deduce the following:
- The primary reason she didn't make the cake is because she didn't have enough butter.
- She implies that if the man had been there, he could have helped buy the butter.
- Additionally, she suggests that she was busy, as she had her "hands full."
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. She was very busy.
- This seems partly accurate, as she did say she had her hands full, indicating she was busy.
B. She was very angry with the man.
- The dialogue does not provide any evidence that she was angry. She merely stated a fact about the man's absence and how it contributed to the situation.
C. She hurt her hands.
- There is no mention or indication of her having hurt her hands in the dialogue.
Considering the dialogue and the options provided, the most relevant answer is:
A. She was very busy. 
Although the main reason she didn't make the cake was the

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. She was very busy.

A: Let's think step by step.
To find the time the two speakers will meet, let's break down the dialogue:
1. M suggests meeting at ten o'clock (10:00).
2. W responds by saying that's too late and suggests meeting 30 minutes earlier than ten o'clock.
Let's calculate:
- Thirty minutes earlier than 10:00 is 9:30.
Therefore, the time the two speakers will meet is 9:30.
The correct answer is:
B. 9:30.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the conversation takes place, we can analyze the dialogue step by step.
1. **Content of the conversation**: 
   - M asks Helen what she is going to have, indicating a choice over items.
   - W replies that she will have "just a hamburger," and then asks M in return.
2. **Contextual clues**:
   - The mention of "hamburger" suggests a setting where food is available for ordering, which aligns more with a dining scenario than shopping or banking.
3. **Options analysis**:
   - **A. In a shop**: Typically, shops involve purchasing goods or items, not choosing and having meals like a hamburger.
   - **B. In a bank**: A bank is a place for financial transactions, not a setting where one would discuss having a hamburger.
   - **C. In a restaurant**: Restaurants are places where meals like hamburgers are ordered and consumed, matching the dialogue context.
Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the conversation takes place in a restaurant. So, the answer is:
C. In a restaurant.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. In a restaurant.

The woman had a stomachache this morning. B. The man is asking for some time off. C. The man felt sick.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the brief dialogue between W (a woman) and M (the man, Tom). 
1. **Identify the roles and context**: W is Mrs. Smith, and M is Tom. Mrs. Smith is asking why Tom was late in the morning. This suggests a scenario where Mrs. Smith might be in a supervisory or authoritative position relative to Tom, like a teacher or boss.
2. **Understanding the dialogue**: 
   - Mrs. Smith asks Tom why he was late.
   - Tom apologizes and provides an explanation, saying he had a stomachache.
3. **Inferring information**: From Tom's response, we can gather that:
   - He was indeed late that morning.
   - The reason given for his lateness is a stomachache.
   - Tom's statement indicates he was not feeling well due to the stomachache.
4. **Evaluating options based on the dialogue**:
   - **Option A**: "The woman had a stomachache this morning." This is not supported by the dialogue; it is Tom who mentions having a stomachache, not Mrs. Smith.
   - **Option B**: "The man is asking for some time off." The dialogue does not

A: Let's think step by step.
In the given dialogue, the man (M) is looking for a summer job that provides exercise. The woman (W) suggests several options:
1. **Life guard**: The man responds that life guards mostly sit and do not swim much, implying he is not interested in this option.
2. **Swimming coach**: The woman suggests he could consider being a swimming coach. The man does not explicitly respond to this suggestion in the dialogue, so we do not have a clear indication that he prefers this option.
3. **Tour guide**: The woman also suggests being a tour guide. The man shows interest in this option by commenting, "Tour guide is a good idea. I'd walk all day." This indicates that he finds this job appealing, as it would involve a lot of walking, which aligns with his desire for exercise.
Based on the man's response, the most likely job he would take in the summer is as a tour guide because it best meets his criteria for a job that offers exercise, and he expresses positive interest in it.
Thus, the answer is:
A. Tour guide.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Tour guide.

Q: dialogue:             Daughter: Dad. You love me, don't you? Father: Of course, I do. Why do you ask ... Ah, what's on your mind? Daughter: Well, I saw this great offer for a free cell phone here in the newspaper, and ... Father: Free? Nothing's ever free. Daughter: Well, the phone is free ... after a $50 mail-in rebate. Father: Ah, so that's the catch. And why do you need a cell phone anyway? Daughter: Dad. All my friends have one, and I can use it to call you in case the car breaks down. Father: Ah, I don't know. There are always so many fees. Daughter: But the monthly charge for this service is only $29.99, with 1,000 free weekday minutes nationwide, and unlimited weekend minutes. Plus, unlimited, anytime minutes for anyone using the same service. Father: I don't know. Daughter: And you can roll over the extra minutes to the next month instead of just losing them. What do you think of that? Father: Yeah, but what is the term of the service agreement? Daughter: It's only for six months. Father: But what if you cancel early? Daughter: Um ... Ah, there's a cancellation fee of $200, but with ... Father: Two hundred bucks! Daughter: Yeah, but you won't have to worry about me while I'm driving the new car. Father: New car? What new car? Daughter: The new car you'll need to buy so I can use the cell phone. I mean, what's it gonna look like if I'm using a cell phone in our old lemon. Father: Teenagers. What'll they think of next?             question:             What reason does the girl give for needing a cellphone?             options:             A. She can call family in case of an emergency. B. She can make cheaper long-distance calls with it. C. She can use it to check her email.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the reason the girl gives for needing a cellphone, let's review the dialogue carefully.
1. The daughter mentions she saw an offer for a cellphone and is trying to convince her dad of its necessity.
2. When expressing her reasoning, she states: "Dad. All my friends have one, and I can use it to call you in case the car breaks down."
   
The specific reason she provides is her ability to call her father in case of an emergency, like the car breaking down. 
Now, let's match this explanation with the given options:
A. She can call family in case of an emergency. - This aligns with her reasoning, as calling her dad if the car breaks down is essentially an emergency situation.
B. She can make cheaper long-distance calls with it. - This is not mentioned as a reason.
C. She can use it to check her email. - This is also not mentioned in the dialogue.
Hence, the correct answer is A. She can call family in case of an emergency.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. She can call family in case of an emergency.

   - **Unlimited, anytime minutes for anyone using the same service**
   - **Roll-over of extra minutes to the next month**
2. **Options Analysis:**
   - **Option A:** "1000 anytime minutes" - The daughter does not mention having 1000 anytime minutes. She talks about having unlimited anytime minutes for people using the same service, but not 1000 anytime minutes.
   - **Option B:** "Unlimited weekday minutes" - The daughter does not mention having unlimited weekday minutes. She specifies 1000 free weekday minutes.

Their car isn't big enough to ride in with all her friends. B. The cellphone's power supply won't work in an older car. C. Their current car is in bad shape, and it doesn't look good.
A: Let's think step by step.
The dialogue involves a conversation between a father and his daughter discussing the potential purchase of a cell phone. As the conversation progresses, the daughter subtly implies that because she would have a new cell phone, it would not look good if she were driving the "old lemon," referring to their current car being in poor condition.
Let's analyze the options:
A. Their car isn't big enough to ride in with all her friends.
- There's no mention in the dialogue about the size of the car or needing more space for friends. This option doesn't connect to the dialogue.
B. The cellphone's power supply won't work in an older car.
- The dialogue does not mention any issues regarding the compatibility of the cellphone's power supply with the car.
C. Their current car is in bad shape, and it doesn't look good.
- The daughter mentions not wanting to be seen using a new cell phone in an "old lemon," which is slang for an old or unreliable car.
Upon evaluating the dialogue and the provided options, it's clear that the daughter is suggesting buying a new car because their current car is in bad shape and doesn't look good. Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. Their current car is in bad shape, and it doesn't look good.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Their current car is in bad shape, and it doesn't look good.

A: Let's think step by step.
In the conversation, the daughter mentions a "great offer for a free cell phone" that she saw in the newspaper. The father is skeptical and asks about the catch. The daughter clarifies that the phone is free after a $50 mail-in rebate. The focus of their dialogue is on the phone being free with certain conditions, such as a mail-in rebate and service contract, but there is no mention of additional accessories or adapters included with the purchase.
Given this information, the most relevant option based on the conversation is:
A. money back for buying the phone (through a $50 mail-in rebate).
The conversation does not mention anything about receiving other cellphone accessories or a cellphone adapter for the car, so options B and C are not supported by the dialogue.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. money back for buying the phone.

W: Come on, you really must think of the future. M: I'll tell you what. I'd like to be a doctor. W: Well, you should think very seriously about that. It means a lot of study, and then working all sorts of hours. M: Yes, maybe. But the idea sounds interesting. W: Well, then, you ought to get more information about it as soon as possible.             question:             Why does the man like his present job?             options:             A. The good pay and the fresh air. B. The good pay and the position. C. The position and the fresh air
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand why the man likes his present job, let's review the dialogue:

Doctor. B. Teaching. C. Gardening.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which job the man is least interested in, let's analyze the dialogue:
- The woman suggests he get another job because gardening is not suitable for a university graduate. The man responds by stating he likes his job as a gardener because the money is good and there's plenty of fresh air. This indicates that he is content with his current gardening job.
- The woman then suggests teaching law. The man's immediate reaction is negative; he says, "Teaching? Anything but that. It's so boring." This shows a strong disinterest in teaching, portraying it as the least appealing option to him.
- Finally, the conversation shifts to the possibility of becoming a doctor. The man expresses interest by saying, "I'll tell you what. I'd like to be a doctor," although he acknowledges the challenges involved. The woman advises him to seriously consider the decision. His openness to the idea suggests he finds it intriguing.
Based on this analysis, the job he shows the least interest in is teaching. Therefore, the correct option is:
B. Teaching.

Husband and wife. B. Friends. C. Boss and clerk.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the probable relationship between the speakers, we should analyze the content and tone of the dialogue. 
1. **Tone and Content**: The conversation is informal and involves personal advice about career choices. The woman is suggesting that the man consider a different profession because she believes his current job isn't suitable given his educational background.
2. **Interaction**: The man seems comfortable responding to the woman's suggestions, even dismissing some of them in a light-hearted manner. This suggests a level of familiarity and comfort, which implies a personal, non-hierarchical relationship.
3. **Nature of Suggestions**: The woman suggests career changes and highlights the importance of thinking about the future. These are discussions that are more common among close friends or family members rather than between a boss and a subordinate, who might discuss more immediate or work-related issues.
4. **Discussion Topics**: The conversation ventures into discussing life goals and long-term planning, which leans towards a personal relationship where such topics are openly discussed.
Considering these aspects, the most suitable relationship is:
**B. Friends.**
Friends often have informal and personal discussions about life choices and provide advice without the professional constraints that would typically define a boss-clerk interaction. The dialogue doesn't reflect the domestic context one might expect from a

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Friends.

He put the woman's books on his bed. B. He put the woman's books on her table. C. He finds the woman's books on her bed.
A: Let's think step by step.
The dialogue involves a woman (W) asking a man (M) about the location of her book. The man's response is, "Yes, they are on your bed."
1. **Understanding the Context**:
    - The woman is looking for her book and asks the man if he has seen it.
    - The man confirms that he has seen the book and provides information about its location.
2. **Analyzing the Man’s Response**:
    - The man says, "they are on your bed." This indicates the location where the woman’s book is currently found.
    - The use of "they" suggests he might be referring to more than one book, but the woman initially asked about a singular book. This could be a nuance in language or a slip; however, the focus here is on the location aspect.
3. **Evaluating the Options**:
   - **Option A: He put the woman's books on his bed.**
     - This is incorrect because the man specifically says "your bed," which refers to the woman’s bed, not his.
   - **Option B: He put the woman's books on her table.**
     - This is incorrect because the man mentions "your bed," not "your table."
   - **Option

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman will do, we need to analyze the dialogue between F (the woman) and M (the man).
1. The woman (F) asks the man (M) if he would mind if she turns the radio off. This indicates she is considering turning it off.
2. The man (M) responds with "Not at all," which means he would not mind if she turns the radio off. He gives her permission or agreement to proceed with her action.
Given this exchange, since the man does not mind, the woman is likely to proceed with her initial intention, which is to turn the radio off.
Therefore, the most logical answer is:

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how long the man works in the morning, we need to look at the information he provided about his work schedule:
1. The man starts work at the library at 8:00 AM.
2. He finishes work around 11:15 AM.
Now, let's calculate the duration of his work:
- He starts at 8:00 AM.
- He finishes at 11:15 AM.
From 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM is 3 hours. 
From 11:00 AM to 11:15 AM is an additional 15 minutes.
Therefore, the total duration of his work in the morning is 3 hours and 15 minutes.
So, the answer is:
C. 3 hours, 15 minutes.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. 3 hours, 15 minutes.

Let's hurry up.             question:             Where are the two speakers?             options:             A. Outside a theatre. B. At a show. C. In a bank.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the two speakers are, let's analyze the dialogue and the context clues provided:
1. **M: Listen! The show is starting.** 
   - This suggests that the location is related to a "show," which is a performance that could take place at a theater or similar venue.
2. **W: How do you know?** 
   - This implies that there is some external indicator that the show is starting.
3. **M: Can't you hear the band? They are playing their instruments.**
   - This detail about hearing a band playing instruments indicates that they are near enough to hear live music playing, typically associated with performances or concerts.
4. **W: Sure, yes. Let's hurry up.**
   - Their need to “hurry up” suggests they are possibly not yet seated or in the exact location of the performance but in a nearby area.
Looking at the options:
- **A. Outside a theatre.** 
  - Since they can hear the band and need to hurry, this option seems plausible because they might be outside where the show is happening and need to get inside quickly.
- **B. At a show.**
  - This implies that they are already settled in the location of the performance. However

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Outside a theatre. This option is the most plausible because the dialogue suggests they are close enough to hear the music and need to hurry, indicating they are

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when the next train will come, we need to consider the schedule mentioned in the dialogue:
1. The train leaves every 30 minutes.
2. The woman is five minutes late for the 7:30 train.
From these points, we can calculate:
- If the 7:30 train has just been missed, considering a 30-minute frequency, the next train after 7:30 would be at 8:00.
Therefore, the next train will come at 8:00.
The correct option is C. At 8:00.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. At 8:00.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how many chairs are needed, we need to ensure that each person has a chair to sit on. According to the dialogue:
- There are 14 people.
- There are currently 13 chairs.
Since each person needs one chair and there are 14 people, we need 14 chairs in total. Therefore, 1 additional chair is needed to have a total of 14 chairs.
Thus, the number of chairs needed is already mentioned in the dialogue ("There are only 13 chairs for 14 of us"), clarifying that there is a shortfall of 1 chair. Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. 14.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. 14.

2. **Jane's Response**: Jane replies that she has not yet made a final decision, but she thinks she is going to take up singing.
3. **Reason for Choice**: Jane provides her reasoning for considering singing: she believes she is good at it, affirmed by her classmates, and she finds it interesting.
4. **Consideration of Audience**: She mentions that singing involves meeting an audience, suggesting she is thinking seriously about performing.
5. **Parental Opinion**: Jane notes that her parents don't quite agree with her idea of becoming a singer, indicating there might be some family pressure against this choice.
6. **Comparison to Art College**: M shares his own experience of parental influence regarding attending an art college to become an actor, suggesting a common theme of parental expectations.

She wants to please the audience. C. Her parents agree to her idea.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the girl wants to take up singing, we need to refer to the dialogue where the girl provides her reasons for considering a singing career.
1. The girl explicitly states: "It's because I am good at singing songs. All my classmates say so."
   - This indicates that her primary reason is her proficiency in singing and positive feedback from her peers.
2. She adds: "Besides, singing is quite interesting, and you will meet a lot of audience."
   - This suggests additional reasons, such as her interest in singing and the opportunity to engage with an audience. However, meeting the audience is more a potential benefit rather than the main reason for choosing singing.
3. The girl also mentions: "And you will have to please them too."
   - This is in response to the notion of engaging the audience, which is a general aspect of performing but not highlighted as her main motivation.
4. Crucially, the girl's parents do not agree with her idea: "They don't quite agree to my idea. That's the only trouble."
Given these points, we can see that the girl's core reason is her confidence in her singing ability as affirmed by her classmates, making Option A the most accurate choice.
The answer is: A. She is good at singing.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. She is good at singing.

Urn... my parents try to send me to an art college because they want me to be an actor. W: Then what will you do? M: Well... I haven't decided yet. But I usually get my own way in the end.             question:             What do the young man's parents want him to do?             options:             A. To go to an art college. B.

Q: dialogue:             W: If the weather is this hot tomorrow, we may as well give up the idea of playing tennis in the afternoon. M: Oh, I don't think it'll last long. The weather forecast says it will cloud over by mid-afternoon             question:             What does the man mean?             options:             A. They shouldn't change their plan. B. They'd better change their mind. C. The tennis game won't last long.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man means in his dialogue with the woman, we need to examine the conversation carefully:
1. **Context**: 
   - The woman (W) is concerned about the weather being too hot to play tennis the next day in the afternoon.
   - The man (M) responds to her concern about the weather.
2. **Man's Statement**:
   - The man says, "Oh, I don't think it'll last long. The weather forecast says it will cloud over by mid-afternoon."
3. **Interpretation**:
   - The phrase "I don't think it'll last long" likely refers to the hot weather not lasting long.
   - He then mentions the weather forecast predicting cloud cover by mid-afternoon, indicating a change in weather.
4. **Conclusion**:
   - The man is essentially suggesting that the current hot weather won't persist into the afternoon when they plan to play tennis.
   - Since the forecast indicates the weather will be cooler (clouding over), there is an implication that they can still proceed with their plan to play tennis.
5. **Option Analysis**:
   - A. "They shouldn't change their plan." - This aligns well with the man's belief that the hot weather won't last and they can still play tennis

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. They shouldn't change their plan.

Q: dialogue:             M: Hello! May 1 speak to Mrs. Arnold? W: Speaking. M: This is Sparkle Company. You are one of the lucky housewives chosen to receive our free soap. W: That's very nice of you. But I'd rather go on using what I've always used. Thanks just the same.             question:             Where is the woman?             options:             A. In her house. B. At an information desk. C. In a soap factory.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the location of the woman (W) in the dialogue, let's analyze the details:
1. **The Nature of the Interaction**:
   - The woman (W) is receiving a phone call from the man (M) who is representing Sparkle Company.
2. **The Setting**:
   - It is mentioned that the man is offering the woman free soap as she is one of the lucky housewives chosen.
3. **Logical Inference**:
   - Since housewives are generally associated with being at home, and free products, like soap, are often distributed as promotions to individuals in their homes, it is logical to infer that the woman is most likely in her house when she receives this call.
4. **Elimination of Other Options**:
   - Option B ("At an information desk"): This doesn't align with the context. Information desks are not commonly associated with receiving promotional calls for free products.
   - Option C ("In a soap factory"): Given the context of the call being about receiving the company's product, it's unlikely for her to be at a soap factory.
Therefore, based on the dialogue and logical reasoning, the most plausible answer is:
A. In her house.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. In her house.

Q: dialogue:             W: This week's program Up Your Street takes you to Harrogate, a small town in Yorkshire. Harrogate became a fashionable resort during Victorian times, when people came to take a bath in the mineral waters. Today, few people come to visit the town for its mineral waters.

Now, to tell us more about Harrogate, I have with me Tom Percival, President of the Chamber of Commerce. Tom, one of the things visitor notices about Harrogate is the large area of open park land right down into the middle of the town. Can you tell us more about it? M: Yes, certainly.

As a special law, no one can build anything on the stray. It's protected forever. W: So it will always be park land? M: That's right. As you can see, some of the Stray is used for sports fields. W: I believe it looks lovely in the spring. M: Yes, it does.

There're spring flowers on the old trees, and people visit the town just to see the flowers.             question:             What do we learn about modern Harrogate?             options:             A. It remains very attractive with its mineral waters. B. It is at the center of the fashion industry. C. It is an ideal place for people to retire to.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best answer, let's examine the information given in the dialogue about modern Harrogate:
1. The dialogue mentions that "Today, few people come to visit the town for its mineral waters," indicating that the mineral waters are no longer a main attraction. This rules out option A, "It remains very attractive with its mineral waters."
2. The dialogue does not mention Harrogate being involved in the fashion industry at all. Instead, it mentions Harrogate as a "fashionable resort during Victorian times," which is historical context, not related to the current situation. Therefore, option B, "It is at the center of the fashion industry," does not fit the information provided.
3. The dialogue states that "Harrogate has become a popular town for people to retire to" and describes attributes that make it ideal for this purpose: "Its clean air, attractive parks, and the absence of any industry, make this an ideal spot for people looking for a quiet life." This directly supports option C, "It is an ideal place for people to retire to."
Therefore, the correct answer is C. It is an ideal place for people to retire to.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. It is an ideal place for people to retire to.

It is located in the eastern part of Harrogate. B. It is protected as parkland by a special law. C. It was named after a land owner in the old days.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we should review what the man, Tom Percival, says about the area called the Stray during the dialogue.
1. **Location of the Stray:** 
   - The dialogue mentions that the Stray is "right down into the middle of the town," but nothing specifically about it being in the eastern part of Harrogate. So, Option A is not supported by the dialogue.
2. **Protection of the Stray:**
   - Tom Percival mentions, "Oh, yes, indeed. As a special law, no one can build anything on the Stray. It's protected forever."
   - This clearly supports Option B since it indicates the area is protected by a special law as parkland.
3. **Name Origin of the Stray:**
   - Tom explains, "It's called that because in the old days, people let their cattle stray on the area, which was common land."
   - The name is derived from its historical use as common land where cattle could stray, not from a land owner's name. So, Option C is incorrect.
Based on this analysis, the man says that the area called the Stray is protected as parkland by a special law. Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. It

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. It is protected as parkland by a special law.

M: You need to try a little harder, okay? W: I know, I will. There's just been a lot going on lately. I'm moving out of my house, and my brother is in the hospital. M: I'm sorry to hear that, but this is the 7th paper you've turned in late. W: I promise I'll get the next one in on time. Just please don't fail me. M: I'll give you one more chance, but just one. Don't let me down.             question:             What is the probable relationship between the speakers?             options:             A. Teacher and student. B. Boss and employee. C. Parent and child.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the probable relationship between the speakers, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. **Context of the Conversation:**
   - M mentions giving a failing grade if papers continue to be late, which suggests an academic setting.
   - W talks about having a hard semester, indicating she is likely a student.
2. **Content Related to Responsibilities:**
   - Late submission of papers and the mention of grades are typically related to a teacher-student scenario in an educational environment.
3. **Authority and Guidance:**
   - M holds the authority to give a failing grade, which is consistent with the role of a teacher assessing student performance.
4. **Emotional Aspects:**
   - W apologizes for the late submissions and provides reasons such as moving out and a family member in the hospital, seeking understanding, which is typical in a student reaching out to a teacher for leniency.
5. **Final Offer of a Second Chance:**
   - M gives W one more chance, typical of a teacher-student relationship where the teacher wants the student to succeed but also emphasizes responsibility.
Given this analysis, the probable relationship between the speakers is best represented by option A: Teacher and student.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Teacher and student.

2. Marissa apologizes and explains that she is having a hard semester. This indicates that she feels regretful and acknowledges her shortcomings.
3. Marissa goes further to elaborate on her personal struggles, mentioning moving out and her brother being in the hospital. This adds context to her situation and implies she feels overwhelmed and possibly stressed by these challenges.
4. Marissa acknowledges the teacher's frustration but asks not to be failed, promising to submit the next paper on time. This shows her desire to remedy the situation and also highlights her concern about the potential negative outcome.
5. Knowing all this, Marissa is most likely feeling "Sorry" as she is apologizing for her actions, explaining her difficult circumstances, and pleading for another chance.

Q: dialogue:             W: Well, Mr Smith, we have had an interesting discussion about your work. Now, tell us something about your after-work activities. M: I guess not much different from everyone else. I'm interested in sport, and I run about 3 miles every day. I particularly enjoy cross-country running, where you have to run across fields, jump over streams and so on. While I'm running I think about all sorts of things, and at the end of a run I'm sometimes surprised to find that I've managed to solve a problem that was on my mind. Next year I'm going to try the London Marathon. It's a long, hard race - 26 miles, or 42 kilometres - and you have to be tough to finish, but I very much want to do it. I worry a bit about getting old and I'd like to prove to myself that I'm still almost as fit as I was twenty years ago. I'm interested in climbing as well as running. I'll never become an expert climber, but I know what I'm doing in the mountains. I successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when I was younger, and I've done a series of easy climbs in the Alps during the last few years. My wife doesn't share my interest in mountains. She agreed to go climbing with me once, but she found that she felt ill as soon as she got above 1000 metres, so we decide to follow different hobbies. W: You certainly seem to enjoy various types of recreation. All right, Mr Smith. Thanks for your interesting talk.             question:             What are the man's hobbies?             options:             A. Running and thinking. B. Running and climbing. C. Running and jumping.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the man's hobbies, let's go through the dialogue:
1. The man, Mr. Smith, mentions that he is interested in sports, specifically stating that he runs about 3 miles every day. He especially enjoys cross-country running, which involves running across fields and jumping over streams.
2. While running, he often thinks about various topics, and sometimes he solves problems that are on his mind by the end of a run. However, thinking is more of a byproduct of running rather than a separate hobby.
3. He also talks about participating in a marathon, indicating his commitment to running as a hobby.
4. In addition to running, Mr. Smith expresses an interest in climbing. He mentions having completed a course in snow and ice climbing and doing a series of easy climbs in the Alps over the last few years.
5. He notes that his wife does not share his interest in climbing, reinforcing that climbing is indeed one of his hobbies.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. Running and thinking - While Mr. Smith does mention thinking while running, it is not presented as a separate hobby.
B. Running and climbing - This option correctly identifies the two activities that Mr. Smith explicitly describes as hobbies.
C. Running and jumping - Jumping is mentioned

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Running and climbing.

W: You certainly seem to enjoy various types of recreation. All right, Mr Smith. Thanks for your interesting talk.             question:             What is the main reason for the man to run every day?             options:             A. To keep fit and healthy. B. To do some cross-country running. C. To finish a course in physical training.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main reason Mr. Smith runs every day, we should analyze his explanation of his running habits. In the dialogue:
1. Mr. Smith indicates that he runs about 3 miles every day and enjoys cross-country running.
2. He mentions that while running, he often solves problems on his mind.
3. He expresses a desire to prove to himself that he is still fit by participating in the London Marathon. He highlights wanting to reassure himself that he is "almost as fit as I was twenty years ago."
Now let's examine the options:
- Option A: To keep fit and healthy. This option aligns with Mr. Smith's motivation to run every day because he wants to maintain fitness, as evidenced by his goal to participate in the marathon and prove his fitness level.
- Option B: To do some cross-country running. While Mr. Smith enjoys cross-country running, it is not stated as his main reason for running every day. It is a type of running he enjoys, but not his primary motivation.
- Option C: To finish a course in physical training. There is no indication in the dialogue that Mr. Smith is running every day to complete a specific course in physical training.
In summary, Mr. Smith primarily runs every day to keep fit and healthy

Q: dialogue:             W: Well, Mr Smith, we have had an interesting discussion about your work. Now, tell us something about your after-work activities. M: I guess not much different from everyone else. I'm interested in sport, and I run about 3 miles every day. I particularly enjoy cross-country running, where you have to run across fields, jump over streams and so on. While I'm running I think about all sorts of things, and at the end of a run I'm sometimes surprised to find that I've managed to solve a problem that was on my mind. Next year I'm going to try the London Marathon. It's a long, hard race - 26 miles, or 42 kilometres - and you have to be tough to finish, but I very much want to do it. I worry a bit about getting old and I'd like to prove to myself that I'm still almost as fit as I was twenty years ago. I'm interested in climbing as well as running. I'll never become an expert climber, but I know what I'm doing in the mountains. I successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when I was younger, and I've done a series of easy climbs in the Alps during the last few years. My wife doesn't share my interest in mountains. She agreed to go climbing with me once, but she found that she felt ill as soon as she got above 1000 metres, so we decide to follow different hobbies. W: You certainly seem to enjoy various types of recreation. All right, Mr Smith. Thanks for your interesting talk.             question:             What is the man going to do next year?             options:             A. Climb the Alps with his wife. B. Do a cross-country running. C. Enter for the London Marathon.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man is going to do next year, let's review the dialogue carefully. The man, Mr. Smith, talks about his after-work activities, which involve running and climbing. In particular, he mentions his interest in running and his plan to participate in a specific event:
1. The man expresses his enjoyment of cross-country running as a regular activity, but he doesn’t specify a future plan related to it.
2. He says, "Next year I'm going to try the London Marathon." This indicates a specific plan for next year.
3. Regarding climbing, he discusses his past experiences and mentions his wife's lack of interest in mountain climbing, but does not mention any particular future climbing plans involving the Alps or his wife.
Therefore, based on the dialogue, the man's specific activity planned for next year is to enter the London Marathon.
So the correct answer is: C. Enter for the London Marathon.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Enter for the London Marathon.

Training for a professional athlete. C. His ways of physical training.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main topic of the man's dialogue, let's analyze what he primarily talks about:
1. **Cross-Country Running:** Mr. Smith begins by discussing his interest in sport, specifically mentioning that he runs about 3 miles every day and that he enjoys cross-country running. He details the nature of cross-country running and how it helps him solve problems.
2. **London Marathon:** He expresses a goal of participating in the London Marathon, explaining its challenges and his desire to prove his fitness level as he ages.
3. **Climbing:** In addition to running, Mr. Smith talks about his interest in climbing, mentioning his experience with snow and ice climbing, and his past climbs in the Alps.
Throughout the dialogue, the man discusses various physical activities he enjoys and emphasizes his engagement in different forms of recreation aimed at maintaining fitness. 
- Option A ("How to do cross-country running") focuses solely on one specific activity mentioned, and while a part of the dialogue, it's not the main focus.
- Option B ("Training for a professional athlete") does not fit the dialogue as he never discusses training to be a professional athlete.
- Option C ("His ways of physical training") encompasses a broader scope of the man's hobbies and activities that maintain his physical fitness, including both

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is Option C: His ways of physical training.

Q: dialogue:             Man: Well, Christmas is almost here. So, what do you want from Santa this year? Micky: A toy car and walkie-talkies. Man: Really? Well, and what about you, Emily? What do you want for Christmas? Emily: If I can't have a Barbie radio, um, I would have some fragile dolls. And if I can't have some fragile dolls, it doesn't really matter what I get. Man: Wow. Well, I'm excited, and Santa is coming. And how is Santa going to get inside the house, Micky? Micky: Um, go down the chimney ... Man: Okay, so he's going to go down the chimney, and should we prepare anything for Santa? Micky: Yeah! Man: What are we going to prepare for him, Emily? Emily: Um. We could prepare some cookies for him and some hot chocolate, and, um, we could give Rudolph some, um, hot chocolate in a bowl and a cookie. And we could give some of the reindeer some cookies and some hot chocolate in a bowl. Man: Well, what do you think? They, Um, reindeer probably don't eat cookies, but what else could we give them, Micky? Micky: Um, apples. Man: Ah, that's good. And, uh ... Emily: Oranges and bananas. Man: Okay and what time do you think we should go to bed? Emily: Um, seven. Man: About seven o'clock. Well, that's exciting. I'm really happy that Christmas is coming.             question:             What does the little boy NOT ask for Christmas?             options:             A. hand-held radio receiver-transmitters B. a toy train C. a play car
A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to look at the dialogue and determine what the little boy, Micky, asks for Christmas:
1. The man asks Micky, "So, what do you want from Santa this year?" 
2. Micky responds with, "A toy car and walkie-talkies."
From Micky's response, we can see that he asks for a "toy car" and "walkie-talkies."
Now let's examine the options given:
A. hand-held radio receiver-transmitters - This is another way to describe "walkie-talkies", which Micky did ask for.
B. a toy train - This is not mentioned in Micky's list.
C. a play car - This is essentially the same as "a toy car," which Micky did ask for.
According to this analysis, the item Micky does NOT ask for is:
B. a toy train

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. a toy train

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the girl, Emily, wants for Christmas, we need to refer back to her part of the dialogue. Emily mentions that if she cannot have a Barbie radio, she would like some fragile dolls. If she cannot have the fragile dolls, she says it doesn't really matter what she gets.
Now, let's review the options given:
A. Barbie playhouse
B. marbles
C. dolls
Emily specifically mentions "some fragile dolls" when listing her desires for Christmas. She did not mention a Barbie playhouse or marbles in the dialogue. Hence, the most consistent option with Emily's response is:
C. dolls
So, the answer is C. dolls.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. dolls.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which foods the children want to prepare for Santa's reindeer, let's revisit the dialogue:
1. **Cookies**: Emily mentions cookies when discussing what to prepare for Santa and Rudolph. Although the man comments that reindeer might not eat cookies, cookies are still mentioned by the children.
2. **Hot chocolate**: Emily suggests hot chocolate for both Santa and the reindeer, but since reindeer typically don't drink hot chocolate, we'll focus more on solid foods.
3. **Apples**: Micky mentions apples when considering what else to give the reindeer after cookies.
4. **Oranges and bananas**: Emily suggests oranges and bananas, but not specifically for reindeer. The focus is more on the typical solid foods reindeer might eat.
5. **Carrots**: Carrots are a common food depicted as being suitable for reindeer, but they aren't mentioned in the dialogue.
Let's match the options:
- **Option A: cookies, apples, and carrots** - Carrots were not mentioned in the conversation.
- **Option B: hot chocolate, oranges, and corn** - Oranges are mentioned, but corn is not, and hot chocolate was not meant as a solid food for the reindeer.
- **Option C: apples,

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. apples, oranges, and cookies

B. It's sweeter. C. It's fresher.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the man recommends the strawberry juice, let's analyze the dialogue provided:
1. The woman asks for a recommendation of a sweet juice for her friend who loves sweet juice.
2. The man mentions that they have both apple juice and strawberry juice, and notes that they are both sweet.
3. The man specifically recommends the strawberry juice, describing it as "upon ordinary."
4. The man then mentions that apple juice was made yesterday and is stored in the refrigerator.
Given the options:
A. It's colder - The dialogue does not mention anything about the temperature of the juices. The apple juice being in the refrigerator is mentioned, but not as a comparison for coldness to the strawberry juice.
B. It's sweeter - The man stated that both juices are sweet, but did not specifically state that one is sweeter than the other.
C. It's fresher - The dialogue specifies that the apple juice was made yesterday, implying it might not be as fresh as the strawberry juice, but there is no direct statement about the freshness of the strawberry juice.
The reason for recommending strawberry juice appears to be subjective ("it's upon ordinary"), but it seems to imply a special quality or taste preference rather than specifying it as being sweeter or fresher. However, given the context and the nature of

W: Yes, but I have to help my little sister with her foreign language. M: How about coming out with me this evening? There's a new film on. W: I'm afraid I can't. A friend of mine is coming from the south and I have to go to the station to meet him. M: What a pity! How about the weekend then? W: No, I've arranged to go to an art exhibition with my parents.

Over the phone. C. At the woman's home.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where this conversation most likely takes place, we should analyze the context and clues in the dialogue:
1. **Initiation of the Conversation**: The conversation begins with "Is that Ann?" which is a question that implies the need for confirmation of identity. This is a common scenario in telephone conversations but less common in face-to-face interactions.
2. **Content of the Conversation**: The discussion involves making plans and asking about the other person's current activities and well-being. Such topics can occur both face-to-face and over the phone.
3. **Absence of Visual or Direct Cues**: There is no indication that the speakers are observing each other or referring to any visual or physical cues, which is typical in face-to-face interactions.
4. **Nature of Invitation and Response**: Mike's invitation to go out, followed by Ann's responses about being busy, do not include any language or actions suggesting they are physically together (e.g., Mike doesn't suggest "look at this flyer," or Ann doesn't say "I can't leave the house now").
5. **Overall Tone and Format**: The conversation is straightforward and lacks any non-verbal communication indicators, often present when people are physically together.
Based on these observations, the clues strongly suggest that the conversation

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Over the phone.

A friend of mine is coming from the south and I have to go to the station to meet him. M: What a pity! How about the weekend then? W: No, I've arranged to go to an art exhibition with my parents. M: What about next week sometime? W: Maybe.             question:             What is the woman going to do tonight?             options:             A. Go to an exhibition with her parents. B. Meet her friend at the station. C. Help her sister with English.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman is going to do tonight, let's break down the dialogue:
1. **Initial Conversation**: Mike and the woman (Ann) exchange greetings. Ann mentions she is very busy, even though she has finished her exams.
2. **Reason for Being Busy**: Ann explains she has to help her little sister with a foreign language.
3. **Inviting Out for the Evening**: Mike invites Ann to go out with him that evening to see a new film. However, Ann declines the invitation.
4. **Reason for Decline**: Ann says she can't go because a friend of hers is coming from the south, and she has to go to the station to meet him.
From these points, we can see that Ann's plan for the evening is to meet her friend at the station.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. Meet her friend at the station.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Meet her friend at the station.

Q: dialogue:             W: You look tired. M: It's been a really busy week. People have been borrowing so many books. This always happens around examination time.             question:             Where does the man probably work?             options:             A. In a supermarket. B. In a bookstore. C. In a library.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the man probably works, let's analyze the dialogue.
- The woman comments that the man looks tired, which suggests he might have been working hard or dealing with a busy workload.
- The man explains that it's been a really busy week, specifically mentioning that "people have been borrowing so many books."
- He also mentions that this surge in book borrowing happens around examination time.
Now, let's consider the options:
A. In a supermarket: Supermarkets typically involve selling groceries and household items, not borrowing books. This option is unlikely.
B. In a bookstore: Bookstores sell books, but typically customers buy books instead of borrowing them. This doesn't fit the scenario described by the man.
C. In a library: Libraries are places where people borrow books, and there tends to be increased borrowing activity around examination times when students need study materials. This aligns well with the man's description of his work situation.
Therefore, the man probably works in C. In a library.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. In a library.

Q: dialogue:             M: Shawn's been trying for months to find a job. But I wonder how he could get a job when he looks like that. W: Oh, that poor guy! He really should shave himself every other day at least and put on something clean.             question:             What do we learn about Shawn?             options:             A. He is ashamed of his present condition. B. He changes jobs frequently. C. He is careless about his appearance.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we learn about Shawn from the dialogue, let's analyze the provided conversation step by step:
1. M states that Shawn has been trying for months to find a job. This indicates that Shawn is currently unemployed and actively seeking employment.
2. M also questions how Shawn could get a job "when he looks like that," implying there is something about Shawn's appearance that could be hindering his job search.
3. W expresses sympathy for Shawn, referring to him as "that poor guy," which may imply that his situation is unfortunate or pitiable.
4. W suggests that Shawn should "shave himself every other day at least" and "put on something clean," implying that his current appearance is unkempt or not presentable.
From these observations, it can be inferred that:
- Shawn is not maintaining a neat appearance, as both M and W imply that he would have better job prospects if he made changes to his personal grooming and attire.
- There is no indication in the dialogue that Shawn is ashamed of his condition (Option A) or that he changes jobs frequently (Option B).
Based on this analysis, the best answer is:
C. He is careless about his appearance.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He is careless about his appearance.

Q: dialogue:             M: I hope you can understand my reasons for deciding to leave, Mrs. Harrison. W: Do I have to remind you that we have invested a lot of time and money in your career here?             question:             What is the most probable relationship between the two speak ers?             options:             A. Mother and son. B. Employer and employee. C. Teacher and student.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most probable relationship between the two speakers, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. **Speaker M's Statement**: M expresses a desire for understanding regarding their decision to leave. This suggests a significant change or a decision affecting both parties, which implies a formal or professional relationship.
2. **Mrs. Harrison's Response**: W mentions the investment of time and money in M's career. This indicates a relationship where one party has invested in the professional development of the other. This is most commonly seen in an employer-employee relationship, where employers often spend resources on training and developing their employees.
3. **Options Analysis**:
   - A. **Mother and Son**: This option is unlikely because a family discussion about career decisions might involve emotional support but would less commonly involve explicit statements about investment in a career.
   - B. **Employer and Employee**: This option is the most fitting. Employers often talk about investing resources into an employee's growth, and when an employee decides to leave, it can be a significant matter for the company.
   - C. **Teacher and Student**: Although teachers do invest time in students, the mention of "career" is less typical in a student-teacher dialogue, unless it were a vocational or professional context,

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Employer and employee.

Q: dialogue:             W: Ray, are you going straight home after school today? M: No. I have a class until 1 o'clock, and after that I'm going to spend a couple of hours at the library before going home.             question:             What is Ray going to do this afternoon?             options:             A. Ray will go to the library at 2:00. B. Ray will have a class at 1:00. C. Ray will go home around 3:00.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what Ray is going to do this afternoon, let's break down the information provided in the dialogue:
1. Ray mentions he has a class until 1 o'clock.
   - This implies his class ends at 1:00.
2. After his class, Ray plans to spend a couple of hours at the library.
   - A "couple of hours" typically means about two hours.
3. If Ray's class ends at 1:00 and he spends around two hours at the library, he will likely leave the library around 3:00.
Now, let's evaluate the given options:
A. Ray will go to the library at 2:00.
   - This is incorrect. Ray would be at the library before 2:00 since his class ends at 1:00.
B. Ray will have a class at 1:00.
   - This is incorrect. Ray's class ends at 1:00, not starts at 1:00.
C. Ray will go home around 3:00.
   - This is correct. Ray will likely head home after spending a couple of hours at the library, which should be around 3:00.
Therefore, the correct option is C. Ray will go home around

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Ray will go home around 3:00.

They are all my friends. W: Who is that man? M: He is Professor Zhang. He is a Chinese teacher. His wife is a teacher, too. Their daughter is a college student. W: Who is that young man? M: He is her boyfriend. He is a young doctor. His name is Karl Black.             question:             What are the people in the house doing?             options:             A. They're watching TV. B. They're having a party. C. They're having dinner.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the people in the house are doing, we need to refer to the conversation between W and M.
1. W observes that there are many people in the house and asks what they are doing.
2. M responds by saying, "We are having a party." This directly addresses W's question regarding the activity in the house.
Based on M's response, it's clear that the people in the house are having a party.
Now, let's match this with the given options:
- A. They're watching TV. (This is incorrect as there's no mention of watching TV in the dialogue.)
- B. They're having a party. (This is correct based on M's response.)
- C. They're having dinner. (This is incorrect; having dinner is not mentioned in the dialogue.)
Therefore, the correct answer is B. They're having a party.

They are all my friends. W: Who is that man? M: He is Professor Zhang. He is a Chinese teacher. His wife is a teacher, too. Their daughter is a college student. W: Who is that young man? M: He is her boyfriend. He is a young doctor. His name is Karl Black.             question:             Who is Karl Black?             options:             A. He is the man's daughter's boyfriend. B. He is the woman's daughter's boyfriend. C. He is Miss Zhang's boyfriend.
A: Let's think step by step.
To identify who Karl Black is, let's break down the information from the dialogue:
1. The dialogue introduces several characters:
   - M (the man, host of the party).
   - W (the woman asking questions).
   - Professor Zhang (a friend of M, a Chinese teacher).
   - Professor Zhang's wife (also a teacher).
   - Their daughter (a college student).
2. The key part of the dialogue we need to focus on is:
   - W asks about "the young man."
   - M replies, "He is her boyfriend," referring to the daughter of Professor Zhang.
   - M specifies that "He is a young doctor" and "His name is Karl Black."
Now, let's match this information with the options provided:
A. He is the man's daughter's boyfriend.
   - There is no mention of M having a daughter in the dialogue, so this option doesn't fit.
B. He is the woman's daughter's boyfriend.
   - There is no mention of W having a daughter in the dialogue, so this option doesn't fit.
C. He is Miss Zhang's boyfriend.
   - This aligns with the information: Professor Zhang's daughter, whose boyfriend is Karl Black. "Miss Zhang" would be a correct reference to the daughter of Professor

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He is Miss Zhang's boyfriend.

Tom's words aren't reliable. C. What Tom said is true.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man implies, we need to analyze the dialogue between the woman (W) and the man (M).
1. **The Woman's Statement**: The woman mentions that she thought Tom said he got A's in all his tests. This suggests that she is either surprised or questioning the accuracy of Tom's claim, as she brings it up in conversation.
2. **The Man's Response**: The man advises Mary that she "should know better than to take Tom's words too seriously." This statement implies a level of skepticism or doubt about the truthfulness or reliability of Tom's statements.
3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - A. "Tom is very responsible." - This option contradicts the man's implied skepticism. If Tom were very responsible, his words would likely be reliable, which isn't what the man suggests.
   - B. "Tom's words aren't reliable." - This option aligns well with the man's suggestion to not take Tom's words too seriously. It indicates that Tom might not always be truthful or accurate.
   - C. "What Tom said is true." - This option directly contradicts the man's implication. If the man believed Tom's statements were true, he wouldn't have implied that Tom's words should be taken lightly

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Tom's words aren't reliable.

B. The man thought the results were beyond their expectations. C. They both enjoyed watching the game.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we learn from the conversation, let's analyze each sentence in the dialogue.
1. "M: Though we didn't win the game, we were satisfied with our performance."
   - The man (M) acknowledges that they didn't win but mentions that they were satisfied with their performance. This indicates a positive feeling towards their effort or how they played, despite the loss.
2. "W: You did a great job. You almost beat the world's champions. It's a real surprise to many people."
   - The woman (W) compliments the man on his performance, noting that they almost beat the world's champions, which was unexpected by many. This suggests that their performance was impressive, even if they didn't win.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. They both felt good about the results of the game.
   - This is possible. The man expressed satisfaction, and the woman praised their effort, implying a positive feeling.
B. The man thought the results were beyond their expectations.
   - While the man expressed satisfaction, he didn't specifically state that the results were beyond their expectations. However, the fact that they almost beat the champions could imply this, but it's not explicitly stated.
C. They both enjoyed watching the game.
   - There's no direct indication that either

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. They both felt good about the results of the game.

2. The character M (Mike) responds, "No, it isn't mine."
This exchange clarifies that the book does not belong to Mike.
3. Mike further states, "It's Sam's."
From Mike's response, we conclude that the book belongs to Sam.
Based on this analysis, the correct answer to the question "Whose book is it?" is:

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man is doing in the dialogue, let's analyze his statements step-by-step:
1. The man begins by asking, "Why don't you go to a show or something tonight?" This question is more of a suggestion than a request for permission or help. He's proposing an activity for the woman to consider.
2. When the woman responds that she thought Judy might like to go to a concert, the man says, "Let's have a look and see what's on... You might try the concert at the Festival Hall." Here, the man is actively suggesting a specific concert as an option.
Based on these observations, the man's actions throughout the dialogue are centered on proposing activities—thus, he is making suggestions.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. Making suggestions.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Making suggestions.

Let's evaluate the options based on this analysis:
- **Option A: He likes the job very much.**
  - While the man acknowledges the job was interesting, he does not state that he liked it very much, especially considering his complaint about the lack of free time.
- **Option B: He doesn't like it because it kept him busy.**
  - This option aligns with the man's comment about having no free time. He explicitly mentions this as a downside, which implies he didn't like how demanding the job was on his time.

Q: dialogue:             W: Couldn't you walk any faster? M: This is the fastest I've ever walked.             question:             What does the man believe?             options:             A. The woman walks slowly. B. The woman couldn't walk. C. The woman is fast walker.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man believes based on the dialogue, we need to analyze the conversation.
1. The woman (W) asks the man (M) if he could walk any faster. This implies that she thinks he is walking slowly or at least slower than she would prefer.
2. The man's response is, "This is the fastest I've ever walked." This indicates that he believes he is walking at his maximum speed and cannot go any faster.
3. Since the man acknowledges he is walking at his fastest pace, it indirectly suggests that he might perceive the woman as being a fast walker, especially if she is accustomed to a quicker pace and is questioning him about his speed.
Considering these points, the most logical belief the man holds is option C: The woman is a fast walker.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. The woman is a fast walker.

Q: dialogue:             M: When did you say the plane would arrive? W: At a quarter to two.             question:             When will the plane arrive?             options:             A. 2:45. B. 1:45. C. 1:15.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when the plane will arrive, we need to understand the expression "a quarter to two." This phrase is a way of telling time and means 15 minutes before two o'clock. 
1. First, recognize what "a quarter to two" means:
   - "Quarter" refers to a quarter of an hour, which is 15 minutes.
   - "To two" means the time leading up to 2:00, so we are counting backward from 2:00.
2. Calculate the time:
   - 2:00 minus 15 minutes equals 1:45.
Therefore, "a quarter to two" translates to 1:45.
Given this understanding, the correct option is:
B. 1:45.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. 1:45.

Q: dialogue:             W: Jack, you look a bit upset. M: Yes. I saw someone in the supermarket today. He was dressed in the same clothes as me. The clothes looked so ugly. W: Oh, that's interesting. M: But when I went up to him, I saw it was me...myself...in the mirror!             question:             Why does the man feel upset?             options:             A. A guy stole his clothes B. Someone said he was ugly C. He found his clothes ugly
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the man feels upset, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. The dialogue begins with W noticing that the man (M, Jack) looks upset.
2. The man explains that he saw someone in the supermarket who was dressed in the same clothes as he was. He remarks that the clothes looked ugly, indicating that he doesn't like the appearance of these clothes.
3. The twist in the story comes when he approaches the person and realizes it is actually himself reflected in a mirror.
From this, we can deduce the reason for his upset state:
- He initially thought someone else was wearing clothes identical to his and described them as ugly.
- Upon realizing that it was his reflection, he understood that the "ugly" clothes were, in fact, his own.
Therefore, the reason the man feels upset is because he finds his own clothes ugly.
So, the correct answer is option C: He found his clothes ugly.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He found his clothes ugly.

They are husband and wife.
A: Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's analyze the dialogue step by step to determine the relationship between the speakers.
1. **Initial Interaction:**
   - The conversation starts with "Excuse me, sir?" suggesting a formal interaction. This indicates that they may not know each other personally.
2. **Introduction:**
   - The woman introduces herself as Jane Smith and mentions she is a designer looking for a job. This suggests a professional context, where the woman is likely approaching the man for employment purposes.
3. **Response from the Man:**
   - The man's response, "Can I help you?" is a formal and professional acknowledgment.
4. **Reference to the Secretary:**
   - The man refers the woman to his secretary, indicating a formal organizational process for job seekers or interviews. This implies a professional and hierarchical relationship rather than a personal one.
5. **Negotiation on Timing:**
   - The woman expresses urgency by saying she can't wait a month for the test, and the man apologizes for the inconvenience. This exchange continues to reflect a professional negotiation, with no personal rapport or informal tone that would typically be present between friends or married couples.
6. **Conclusion:**
   - Throughout the dialogue, there is no indication of personal familiarity or informal language that would suggest

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. They are strangers to each other.

M: Next month. W: I can't wait that long. M: Excuse me? W: I can't wait a month. I need something sooner. M: I'm sorry.             question:             Why does the woman come to talk with the man?             options:             A. To see the secretary. B. To take a test. C. To get a job.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the woman came to talk with the man, we need to analyze the dialogue:
1. The woman, Jane Smith, introduces herself as a designer who is looking for a job. This suggests that her primary intention is related to employment.
   
2. The man responds by directing her to his secretary to set her up with a test. The test is likely part of the job application process.
3. The woman expresses urgency, stating she cannot wait a month for the test, underscoring her need for a job soon.
Given these points, let's evaluate the options:
A. **To see the secretary**: This is not her primary purpose; the man suggests she see the secretary after she expresses her intention for a job.
   
B. **To take a test**: Taking the test is part of the process she needs to go through as per the man's direction, but her initial reason for talking with the man isn't to take the test specifically.
C. **To get a job**: The dialogue opens with Jane stating she is a designer looking for a job, indicating this is her primary reason for approaching the man.
The most accurate answer is:
C. To get a job.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. To get a job.

M: Next month. W: I can't wait that long. M: Excuse me? W: I can't wait a month. I need something sooner. M: I'm sorry.             question:             What does the man mean by saying sorry?             options:             A. He can't hear the woman clearly. B. He can't help the woman. C. He doesn't need a designer.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man means by saying "I'm sorry," let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Initial Interaction:**
   - The woman introduces herself as a designer looking for a job.
   - The man directs her to meet his secretary to set up a test for her.
2. **Scheduling Conflict:**
   - The woman asks when the test will be.
   - The man responds that it will be next month.
3. **Woman's Urgency:**
   - The woman expresses that she can't wait a month and needs something sooner, indicating a sense of urgency.
4. **Man's Apology:**
   - The man responds with "I'm sorry," following the woman's expression of her need for an earlier opportunity.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **Option A:** "He can't hear the woman clearly."
  - The man doesn't express any trouble hearing or understanding the woman. Rather, his response indicates he understands her urgency but can't accommodate it.
- **Option B:** "He can't help the woman."
  - This seems to align with the context. The man's "I'm sorry" likely means he is unable to offer an alternative arrangement that suits the woman's time frame.
- **Option C:** "He doesn't need a designer."

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. He can't help the woman.

Q: dialogue:             W: I've noticed that you spend a lot of time tending your garden. Would you like to join our gardening club? We meet every other Wednesday. M: Oh, thanks for the invitation, but this is how I relax. I'd rather not make it something formal and structured.             question:             What can we infer about the man?             options:             A. He is a professional gardener in town. B. He prefers to keep his gardening skills to himself. C. He declines to join the gardening club.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct inference about the man in this dialogue, we should carefully analyze the conversation and each option.
1. **Understanding the Dialogue**: 
   - Woman (W) observes that the man (M) spends a lot of time gardening and invites him to join a gardening club.
   - Man (M) declines the invitation because he prefers to keep gardening as a relaxing activity and does not want it to be a formal and structured commitment.
2. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **Option A**: He is a professional gardener in town.
     - This is not supported by the dialogue. There is no mention of his professional status in gardening; the conversation focuses on gardening as a hobby.
   - **Option B**: He prefers to keep his gardening skills to himself.
     - While he does decline the invitation, the reason provided is not about keeping skills to himself, but rather about maintaining relaxation.
   - **Option C**: He declines to join the gardening club.
     - This is directly supported by the dialogue. The man explicitly declines the invitation to join the club.
3. **Conclusion**: 
   - Based on the dialogue, the most straightforward and supported inference is Option C. He declines to join the gardening club.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He declines to join the gardening club.

I'm glad I could help.             question:             What did the woman do?             options:             A. She helped the man. B. She asked the man to help her. C. She got a new job.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman did, we need to analyze the dialogue between M (the man) and W (the woman).
1. M's statement: 
   - The man says, "You did a fine job on the room I don't think I've ever seen it so clean." This indicates that the woman was responsible for cleaning the room, and the man is complimenting her on the quality of the work.
2. W's response: 
   - The woman responds with, "Oh, it's nothing. I'm glad I could help." Her response suggests that she views her contribution as minor or effortless and confirms her intention was to assist in some way.
Based on the dialogue, let's evaluate the options:
A. She helped the man.
   - This option aligns with the dialogue, as the woman acknowledges that her action, presumably cleaning the room, was helpful.
B. She asked the man to help her.
   - This option does not fit the dialogue, as there is no indication or evidence that she requested help from the man.
C. She got a new job.
   - This option is irrelevant in the context of the dialogue, as there is no mention of employment or job change.
Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the woman helped the man, making

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. She helped the man.

The dialogue involves two people, M and W. M asks W to buy two packs of cigarettes while she is at the store. However, W responds by saying she is not going to any store but is going to see Aunt Mary instead. She does, however, offer to get the cigarettes at the gas station. 
From this, we can conclude that W plans to stop at a gas station to buy cigarettes for M. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "Where will the woman stop on her way?" is option:
A. At a gas station.

It's not too far for her to carry the bags. B. She can get a taxi in 10 minutes. C. The bus stop is just 10 minutes' walk.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's analyze the dialogue between the man (M) and the woman (W).
1. The woman responds to the man's offer of help by saying, "Thanks, but it's only ten minutes walk from here to the bus stop."
   
2. The phrase "ten minutes walk from here to the bus stop" implies that the bus stop is relatively close and it should be manageable for her to walk there with her bags.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. It's not too far for her to carry the bags.
   - This option suggests that the woman believes the distance is manageable for her to carry her bags, which aligns with her response to the man.
B. She can get a taxi in 10 minutes.
   - The dialogue does not mention anything about a taxi, nor does it imply she plans to get a taxi.
C. The bus stop is just 10 minutes' walk.
   - This option directly relates to what the woman said, as she explicitly mentioned that the bus stop is only a ten-minute walk.
Upon examining the options, we conclude that:
- Option A interprets her statement as it's manageable for her to carry the bags, while option C directly quotes the distance information she provided.
- Both A and C are

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. The bus stop is just 10 minutes' walk.

To do more exercise.
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand why the woman participated in the Healthy Living Day, we need to look at her reasons as mentioned in the dialogue.
1. **Exploring the reason**: 
   The woman states, "I wanted to do a new activity, so I went with my cousin Georgia."
2. **Analyzing additional context**:
   The woman added that her cousin Georgia doesn't do enough exercise and that they made lots of new friends.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the next Healthy Living Day, let's review the dialogue for any mentions of dates. According to the conversation:
1. W mentions that they have just booked a place for July 5th but also indicates that the next event is happening on May 28th.
2. M mentions being free most Saturdays after April 14th, but no event is specifically identified as falling on April 14th, and hence it's not relevant in terms of future events.
   
We are trying to determine the "next" Healthy Living Day, which means the nearest one in the future. Based on the dialogue:
- April 14th is only mentioned as a general availability date for M and is not tied to an event.
- May 28th is explicitly mentioned as the next Healthy Living Day.
- July 5th is later than May 28th and hence comes after the May date.
Therefore, the correct answer to when the next Healthy Living Day is scheduled is:
A. May 28th.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. May 28th.

I'm going to do advanced skateboarding. I wanted to try boating but that group is full. M: Wow! I'd like to do that too!             question:             Which sport has the woman chosen for the next Healthy Living Day?             options:             A. Cycling. B. Boating. C. Skateboarding.
A: Let's think step by step.

Based on this information, the sport W has chosen for the next Healthy Living Day is C. Skateboarding.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Skateboarding.

W: The music group? I can't stand the noisy places. Now where's the menu? M: It's on the wall, madam, on the blackboard. W: Indeed. I suppose you can't afford proper menus. M: I'm sorry, madam, but that's what we always do. W: Oh, If I weren't so hungry, I would leave immediately.             question:             Where does this conversation take place?             options:             A. In a concert hall. B. In a theatre. C. In a restaurant.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the location of the conversation, let's break down the dialogue:
1. **Opening Line by M:** "Have you booked a table, madam?"
   - The mention of booking a table suggests a setting where seating reservations are common, such as a restaurant or possibly a venue with table service.
2. **Response by W:** "Yes, we've booked one for two. The name is Morrison."
   - This confirms that a table has been reserved and indicates the activity involves dining or attending an event where booking in this manner is typical.
3. **M's Next Statement:** "Oh, yes, we have the table for you near the group. This way, please."
   - The reference to "the group" could suggest live entertainment, which is often found in restaurants with performances or music venues.
4. **W's Response to Noise:** "The music group? I can't stand the noisy places."
   - This implies that there is live music or significant noise, which could be from a live band often seen at some restaurants.
5. **Inquiry about the Menu:** "Now where's the menu?"
   - A menu is a staple of dining establishments, reinforcing the idea of this being a restaurant setting.
6. **Menu Information by M:** "

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. In a restaurant.

W: Oh, If I weren't so hungry, I would leave immediately.             question:             How does the woman feel in the conversation?             options:             A. Excited. B. Curious. C. Unhappy.
A: Let's think step by step.
First, let's consider the dialogue between the man (M) and the woman (W).
1. The woman has booked a table but immediately expresses displeasure because it is near the music group. She says, "I can't stand the noisy places." This indicates she is not happy with the table's location.
2. She comments on the menu being on the blackboard, suggesting it is not up to her expectations by saying, "I suppose you can't afford proper menus."
3. She also mentions, "If I weren't so hungry, I would leave immediately," which clearly shows her dissatisfaction with the situation but also that she feels compelled to stay due to her hunger.
From these points, we can conclude that the woman is expressing dissatisfaction and frustration with both the placement of the table and the lack of paper menus. 
Therefore, the best choice that reflects the woman's feelings in the conversation is:
C. Unhappy.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Unhappy.

Q: dialogue:             M: Have you booked a table, madam? W: Yes, we've booked one for two. The name is Morrison. M: Oh, yes, we have the table for you near the group. This way, please. W: The music group? I can't stand the noisy places. Now where's the menu? M: It's on the wall, madam, on the blackboard. W: Indeed. I suppose you can't afford proper menus. M: I'm sorry, madam, but that's what we always do. W: Oh, If I weren't so hungry, I would leave immediately.             question:             What is the woman going to do next?             options:             A. Sit down to order. B. Start to work immediately. C. Talk to the group.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman is going to do next, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. The woman and man discuss the reservation, indicating that they are at a restaurant.
2. The woman confirms they have booked a table for two under the name Morrison.
3. The man mentions that the table is near a group (likely a group of musicians or a music group).
4. The woman expresses discontent, saying she can't stand noisy places.
5. When asked about the menu, the man points out that it's on the wall, implying they do not have printed menus at the table.
6. The woman then makes a critical remark about the lack of proper menus and expresses that if she weren't so hungry, she would leave.
Given this context:
- Option A ("Sit down to order") seems likely because despite her complaints about the noise and the menu situation, she indicates she is very hungry, which suggests she will proceed to eat.
- Option B ("Start to work immediately") is irrelevant as the focus of the dialogue is on dining and her hunger, not work.
- Option C ("Talk to the group") seems unlikely because she has already stated she can't stand noisy places, implying she would prefer not to interact with the music group.
Considering these points, the most logical

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Sit down to order.

Q: dialogue:             M: Amy, my head is spinning! It must be a touch of the sun. W: You'd better lie back still for a while. Take it easy for the rest of the day, and stay in the shade. It's too hot today.             question:             How does the man feel?             options:             A. Tied. B. Thirsty. C. Dizzy.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how the man feels, let's examine the dialogue closely:
1. The man, referred to as "M," explicitly says, "Amy, my head is spinning!" This phrase indicates a sense of dizziness or vertigo. The sensation of one's head spinning is commonly associated with feeling dizzy.
2. No other feelings or symptoms like being tired or thirsty are mentioned by the man. His statement focuses on the sensation in his head, which aligns with dizziness.
3. The woman, "W," advises him to lie back, take it easy, and stay in the shade, acknowledging that the day is very hot. Her response suggests that his condition might be related to heat exposure, which can cause dizziness.
Considering these points, the best option that accurately describes how the man feels is option C: Dizzy.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Dizzy.

Q: dialogue:             M: I haven't seen Tommy for days. F: He is in hospital.             question:             What's the matter with Tommy?             options:             A. He is ill. B. He works in hospital. C. He has gone to school.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer to the question "What's the matter with Tommy?" we need to analyze the dialogue between M and F.
1. M mentions that he hasn't seen Tommy for days, which suggests that Tommy is not attending their usual activities or routines.
2. F responds by informing M that Tommy is "in hospital."
Now, let's evaluate each of the provided options:
A. He is ill. - This is a plausible explanation because being in a hospital typically suggests that someone might be receiving medical treatment or care for an illness or injury.
B. He works in hospital. - This option doesn't align well with the dialogue, as F's response seems to be in the context of explaining Tommy's absence, not indicating his employment.
C. He has gone to school. - This option does not make sense in the context of the dialogue, as being in a hospital is unrelated to attending school.
Considering the dialogue and the options provided, the most logical conclusion is that Tommy is in the hospital because he is likely ill or requires some sort of medical attention. Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. He is ill.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. He is ill.

Hurry to the conference. C. Take a bus.
A: Let's think step by step.
In the dialogue, M presents two options to W based on her priorities:
1. **Taking the subway** if she is in a hurry.
2. **Taking a bus** if she wants to go sightseeing.
W responds by saying, "Actually, I don't have to be at the conference before noon." This implies that W is not in a hurry. Therefore, based on M's advice and W's availability of time, it's more likely that she will choose the option that allows for sightseeing.
Given these choices and reasoning:
- Option A (Take the subway) is associated with being in a hurry, which W does not need to be.
- Option B (Hurry to the conference) contradicts W's statement that she doesn't need to be there before noon.
- Option C (Take a bus) aligns with the leisurely approach of sightseeing since W has the time to spare.
Therefore, the woman will probably take a bus. The correct answer is:
C. Take a bus.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Take a bus.

2. "M" says, "Here is a concert ticket for you. I hope you will like it."
3. "F" responds, "Thanks, Dad!"
Based on this exchange:
- "M" specifically mentions giving a "concert ticket."
- "F" acknowledges receiving the ticket by thanking her dad.

M: Well, see as much as you can, because it's a country with a very different culture from ours.             question:             The man advised the woman to ________.             options:             A. enjoy herself thoroughly B. remember her culture C. find her way around
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze the dialogue between W (the woman) and M (the man):
1. W mentions that she is going to India next month and asks if there is any advice M would like to give her for the trip.
2. M responds with advice: "see as much as you can, because it's a country with a very different culture from ours."
Now, let's evaluate what the man is advising based on the options:
A. enjoy herself thoroughly - This option suggests having a good time and fully enjoying the experience. While the man doesn't explicitly say "enjoy yourself," his advice to "see as much as you can" implies immersing oneself in the experience, which correlates with enjoying the trip thoroughly.
B. remember her culture - This doesn't directly relate to M's advice. The man mentions India's culture being different, but the focus is on seeing and experiencing India's culture rather than remembering her own.
C. find her way around - This implies navigating the place, which isn't directly covered in M's advice. His focus is on seeing and experiencing rather than finding directions or navigating.
Based on this analysis, the most fitting option is:
A. enjoy herself thoroughly
The man's advice to "see as much as you can" suggests

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. enjoy herself thoroughly

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the conversation most likely takes place, we should consider the content of the dialogue and the options given:
1. **Dialogue Content**: 
   - M mentions that the "meat has gone bad."
   - W suggests telling the "manager" about it.
2. **Context Clues**:
   - The mention of "meat" indicates a setting where meat is available.
   - The presence of a "manager" suggests a location that sells or manages products, where customer service or quality control can be involved.
3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A. In a library**: Libraries do not sell or handle perishable items like meat. Therefore, it's unlikely the conversation takes place in a library.
   - **B. In a hospital**: Hospitals focus on healthcare and are not primarily places where meat is sold. This doesn't fit the scenario well.
   - **C. In a supermarket**: Supermarkets sell various food items, including meat. They have managers who oversee the store's operations and product quality. This setting is consistent with the conversation's context.
Based on the analysis, the most likely location for the conversation is in a supermarket. Therefore, the selected option should be:
C. In a supermarket.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. In a supermarket.

4. She further mentions that Tony Parker is not available at the moment as he is out all afternoon, and might not be able to return the call until tomorrow.
So, based on the information given in the dialogue:

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the dialogue piece by piece:
1. **Speaker M**: "It's ten o'clock and Tom is still in bed."
   - This suggests that Tom is not up at the usual time, possibly indicating something unusual about his condition or behavior.
2. **Speaker W**: "He has caught a bad cold and coughed all night."
   - This directly states that Tom has a bad cold and has been coughing throughout the night. Coughing and having a cold are symptoms of being sick or ill.
3. **Question**: "What's the matter with Tom?"
   - This question is asking for the reason or condition causing Tom's current state.
4. **Options**:
   - A. He is very cold.
     - This could imply that Tom is feeling cold, but doesn't match the information given in the dialogue. The word "cold" here is part of the phrase "caught a bad cold," referring to illness, not temperature.
   - B. He is lazy.
     - This would imply a behavioral trait, but again, it doesn't align with the mentioned symptoms.
   - C. He is ill.
     - This option directly corresponds to the symptoms described (having a bad cold and coughing all

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He is ill.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the current time, we need to use the information given in the dialogue:
1. W says, "The meeting starts at eight thirty." This means the meeting is set to begin at 8:30.
2. M says, "We still have thirty minutes." This indicates that there are 30 minutes remaining before the meeting begins at 8:30.
3. If there are 30 minutes left before the meeting starts at 8:30, we need to subtract 30 minutes from 8:30 to find the current time. 
4. Subtracting 30 minutes from 8:30 gives us 8:00.
Therefore, the current time is 8:00.
The correct option is B. It's eight o'clock.

That's what I really like, a bit of romance and excitement.             question:             What does the shop sell?             options:             A. Books. B. Food. C. Clothes.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the shop sells, let's analyze the dialogue closely:
1. **Mr. Roberts mentions "a very good literature section"**: This suggests that the shop is related to books because "literature" is typically associated with written works such as novels, essays, and poetry.
2. **He also mentions "a little care where you can go and read a book in peace"**: This reinforces the idea that the shop has a strong connection to books, as it provides a space specifically for reading.
3. **Mrs. White asks about "nice love stories"**: Love stories would be considered a type of book or genre within literature, again pointing to the fact that books are involved.
From these points, it is evident that the shop sells books. The entire conversation revolves around literature and book-related activities, and there is no mention of food or clothes within the context provided.
Therefore, the answer is: A. Books.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Books.

Q: dialogue:             W: Did you tell Mr. Smith to bring the dictionary he promised me? M: The dictionary? Oh, I am sorry.             question:             Why did the man apologize?             options:             A. He had lost the dictionary. B. He had forgotten to bring the dictionary. C. He had forgotten to tell Mr. Smith to bring the dictionary.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the man apologized, we need to analyze the dialogue.
1. The woman (W) asks a question: "Did you tell Mr. Smith to bring the dictionary he promised me?"
   - This implies that Mr. Smith was supposed to bring a dictionary, and the man (M) might have been responsible for reminding or telling Mr. Smith.
2. The man's response is: "The dictionary? Oh, I am sorry."
   - His expression of surprise and apology suggests that there was something he was expected to do regarding the dictionary.
3. Option Analysis:
   - A. "He had lost the dictionary." - This does not fit the context, as there is no mention of the man possessing or losing the dictionary.
   - B. "He had forgotten to bring the dictionary." - There is no indication that the man was supposed to bring the dictionary himself; the expectation was for Mr. Smith to bring it.
   - C. "He had forgotten to tell Mr. Smith to bring the dictionary." - This fits well, as the woman's question specifically asked if the man told Mr. Smith to bring it. The man's apology suggests he might have forgotten to convey this message.
Thus, the most logical reason for the man's apology is that he

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He had forgotten to tell Mr. Smith to bring the dictionary.

Q: dialogue:             M: Hi, Kate! Is your daddy at home? W: No, Mr. Smith. He went out 10 minutes ago. Any message? M: Hmm. Could you tell him to call me back? W: Sure. Leave it to me.             question:             Who is Mr. Smith?             options:             A. A friend of the girl's father. B. The girl's father. C. The girl's brother.
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand who Mr. Smith is, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. **Participants**: 
   - M is speaking with Kate. 
   - W is Kate, who refers to her own father as "your daddy."
2. **Statements**:
   - M asks Kate if her daddy is at home, indicating M does not live with them and is likely not a family member.
   - Kate responds that her father went out, implying M is not her father.
   - M asks Kate to tell her father to call him back.
3. **Names**:
   - Only M is directly referred to as Mr. Smith. 
   - The context implies Mr. Smith is not Kate’s father because she refers to M as Mr. Smith, not daddy.
Based on the analysis above, Mr. Smith is a separate individual, likely a friend or acquaintance of Kate's father who is calling to speak with him.
The most fitting option is:
A. A friend of the girl's father.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. A friend of the girl's father.

Q: dialogue:             M: Hi, Laura. Where are you heading with that big bag? W: I'm offto the gym. I've got to stay in shape, you know. M: I know more women who exercise than men. What's the main reason you do that? For your health, or to look good? W: To be honest, for both. With women, good looks are always a very important consideration. M: I see. W: How about you? Do you get any regular exercise? M: I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment-sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time-but I never go to the gym like you do. W: Well, walking is a good exercise. How about sports? M: Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now. Mostly I just watch sports on TV W: I play tennis fairly regularly with my friends and sometimes go swimming and cycling by myself. M: Oh, I forgot about that. I go cycling sometimes too. And I often go swimming on vacation, but only recreational swimming. W: Why don't you join me at the gym sometime? M: Well, maybe someday, but I'm pretty lazy about things like that.             question:             What do you know about the man?             options:             A. He likes cycling very much. B. He plays baseball regularly now. C. He exercises regularly.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what we know about the man based on the dialogue, let's analyze the relevant parts of their conversation:
1. **Cycling**: The man mentions, "I go cycling sometimes too", which indicates that he does enjoy cycling occasionally but doesn't suggest that he does it very frequently or passionately. Thus, the option "He likes cycling very much" may not be strongly supported by the conversation, as "sometimes" suggests it is not a regular or an intense activity.
2. **Baseball**: The man says, "Not since my school days. I used to love playing baseball, but it's impossible to get enough people together for a game now," when asked about sports. This indicates that he used to play baseball, but he doesn’t play it regularly now. Thus, "He plays baseball regularly now" is incorrect.
3. **Exercise**: The man says, "I do a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment—sometimes ten to twenty kilometers at a time," which implies that he does have a regular form of exercise, specifically walking. While he also mentions that he never goes to the gym, his walking routine does indicate regular exercise.
Based on this analysis, the best supported option is:
C. He exercises regularly.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He exercises regularly.

In the man's home. B. In the street. C. In the gym.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most likely location for this conversation, let's analyze the context and content of the dialogue:
1. **Nature of the conversation**: The man and woman are discussing exercise habits and activities. The woman mentions heading to the gym and carrying a big bag which likely contains gym equipment or clothes.
2. **Details about the speakers' actions**: 
   - The woman is "off to the gym," suggesting she is on her way there rather than already at the gym.
   - The man describes his exercise habits, mentioning that he never goes to the gym like the woman does, and discusses other activities like walking, which implies this conversation is not taking place in a gym environment.
3. **Setting clues**:
   - Since the woman is carrying a big bag and says she is heading to the gym, it suggests she is not at her destination yet and likely having this conversation in transit.
From this analysis, it seems most plausible that the conversation is taking place in a transitional area where people can encounter each other, such as a street. Therefore, the answer is:
B. In the street.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. In the street.

Because she is not in good health. B. Because she wants to show her interest in sports. C. Because she want to be healthy and stay in shape.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the woman is keen on sports, we can analyze her dialogue with Mike:
1. **Initial Context**: The woman, Laura, is on her way to the gym with a big bag. This indicates she is actively engaged in physical activities.
2. **Main Reason for Exercising**: Mike asks whether Laura exercises primarily for health or to look good. Laura responds, “To be honest, for both.” She explicitly mentions that "good looks are always a very important consideration" for women.
3. **Implications of the Response**: Her answer suggests that both health and physical appearance are important to her, which are common reasons many people engage in sports and regular exercise.
4. **Additional Context**: Laura mentions playing tennis regularly and participating in swimming and cycling, indicating a consistent interest and engagement in physical activities.
Based on this dialogue, the primary reasons Laura engages in sports are to be healthy and stay in shape. This aligns with Option C.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. Because she wants to be healthy and stay in shape.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Because she wants to be healthy and stay in shape.

The woman works at university. B. The woman goes to the gym regularly. C. The man enjoys free exercise.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to analyze the dialogue and consider the relevant information provided:
1. **Woman's Activities:**
   - The woman mentions she's heading to the gym, indicating that she exercises regularly. She talks about staying in shape and mentions the importance of both health and appearance, suggesting a habitual commitment to exercise, particularly at the gym.
2. **Man's Activities:**
   - The man mentions he does a lot of walking for exercise and enjoyment, indicating he prefers free exercise (walking, which doesn't need gym membership or special equipment). He also talks about cycling sometimes and swimming during vacations, which are also forms of free physical activities, rather than structured, paid, or organized exercises like going to a gym. 
3. **Additional Context:**
   - The dialogue does not provide any information about the woman's profession or her affiliation with a university, so there's no basis to infer that she works at a university.
Therefore, given these points:
- **Option A** is not supported because there is no indication she works at a university.
- **Option B** is supported because she is going to the gym, suggesting regular attendance.
- **Option C** is supported because he describes activities that involve free exercise, such as walking, cycling, and recreational

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. The woman goes to the gym regularly.

A: Let's think step by step.
To identify the correct telephone number, we need to refer back to the dialogue where the number is explicitly mentioned.
1. The conversation begins with M asking the operator to dial a specific number.
2. M provides the number: "The number is 393-5331."
3. The operator (W) repeats back the number while attempting the call: "Hello. Is this 393-5331?"
4. Upon confirmation, the operator indicates that it's the correct number.
Now, let's review the options:
- A. 393-5331
- B. 393-5133
- C. 392-5661
From the dialogue, the number provided by M and repeated by W is 393-5331. Hence, the correct option is A. 393-5331.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. 393-5331.

C. $ 2 a minute.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct cost from the dialogue provided, we need to carefully consider what the operator said about the pricing:
1. The operator (W) states, "That will be two dollars for the first three minutes."
Let's analyze each option in the context of the operator’s statement:
- **Option A: $2 for the first three minutes.** 
  - This option directly matches the statement made by the operator. It specifies that the cost is $2 specifically for the first three minutes of the call.
  
- **Option B: $2 for three minutes.** 
  - This option is very similar to option A but lacks the specification of "the first" three minutes. It implies that $2 covers just any three minutes, which could potentially lead to a different interpretation, although in this context, it's quite close.
  
- **Option C: $2 a minute.** 
  - This option implies a cost of $2 for every single minute, which does not align with the operator's statement. If this were true, the cost for three minutes would be $6, not $2.
Considering all the information and the operator’s exact words, **Option A: $2 for the first three minutes** is the most accurate choice, as it

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. $2 for the first three minutes.

To determine the man's current age, we can follow these steps:
1. The man has been working at the company for 8 years.
2. He started working there when he was 21 years old.
By adding these two numbers together, we can calculate his current age:
21 (age when he started) + 8 (years he has been at the company) = 29
Therefore, the man is currently 29 years old.

To determine Jane's brother's age:
1. We know from the dialogue that Jane is sixteen years old.

She might be having lunch now. C. She's perhaps nearby.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman is implying about Kelly, we can analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Context**: The man (M) is looking for Kelly to go for lunch together. He asks the woman (W) if she has seen Kelly.
2. **Response from the woman (W)**: The woman responds by mentioning that Kelly's bag is on the chair.
3. **Implication**: The woman's statement suggests that since Kelly's bag is still present, she might not have gone far. Normally, people don't leave their belongings behind unless they plan to return soon. 
Let's evaluate the options:
- **A. She forgot her bag**: This is unlikely in the given context because there's no evidence that Kelly left; her presence could be indicated by her belongings.
- **B. She might be having lunch now**: This doesn't align with the woman's implication, as it would be expected for someone at lunch to take their belongings, especially a bag.
- **C. She's perhaps nearby**: This option aligns best with the woman's statement about the bag being present. It implies that Kelly is nearby since her bag is still there, suggesting she hasn't gone far.
Given the woman's mention of the bag and the common behavior associated with personal belongings,

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. She's perhaps nearby.

To determine the correct answer, let's consider the information provided:
1. **Statement from the dialogue:**  
   M: "They have gone to the playground."
2. **Interpretation:**  
   - The phrase "have gone" indicates that Tom and Jim left for the playground. It implies a completed action in the past with a present relevance.
   - However, it does not specify whether they are still there or have returned.
3. **Analyzing the options:**
   - **Option A (Yes, they are):** This option suggests that Tom and Jim are currently at the playground. While it's possible, the original reference "have gone" doesn't confirm they are still there.
   - **Option B (No, they aren't):** This option suggests they are not at the playground. The dialogue doesn't provide evidence to support this.
   - **Option C (They were, and now they are back):** This option indicates that Tom and Jim were at the playground but have since returned. Again, the dialogue doesn't specify this.
4. **Conclusion:**  
   The statement "They have gone to the playground" primarily highlights a past event that leads to a present situation. It is most aligned with Option A, assuming they haven't returned yet since there's no explicit

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Yes, they are.

Q: dialogue:             W: When will you be back? M: In an hour. W: Can you come much earlier?             question:             What does the man mean?             options:             A. It'll be too early. B. He doesn't Want the woman to leave. C. It'll be a bit late.
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what the man means, we need to analyze the dialogue and the context provided.
1. **Context Understanding:**
   - The woman (W) asks the man (M) when he will be back, and he replies "In an hour."
   - The woman then asks if he can come much earlier.
2. **Implications:**
   - The man's initial response "In an hour" implies that he has a schedule or timeframe within which he is returning.
   - The woman's request for him to come earlier suggests that she has a need or urgency for him to be back sooner than his stated hour.
3. **Analyzing Options:**
   - **A. It'll be too early.** 
     - This suggests that the man find returning earlier than planned as impractical or impossible. This option might make sense because he originally indicated an hour, and there’s no indication he agreed to return earlier.
   
   - **B. He doesn't want the woman to leave.** 
     - There is no direct information or implication in the dialogue that suggests the man is concerned about the woman leaving or staying, so this option is less relevant.
   
   - **C. It'll be a bit late.** 
     - The woman wants him to

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. It'll be too early.

Q: dialogue:             M: I'd like to make two reservations on Flight 651 for June 8th. W: I'm sorry, we're booked up on the 8th. But we still have a few seats available on the 9th.             question:             When does the man want to leave?             options:             A. On the 9th of June. B. On the 6th of June. C. On the 8th of June.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when the man wants to leave, we should pay attention to his request in the dialogue. The man explicitly states, "I'd like to make two reservations on Flight 651 for June 8th." This indicates that his desired date of departure is June 8th. 
Now let's look at the choices:
A. On the 9th of June. - This option suggests a different date than what the man initially requested.
B. On the 6th of June. - This option suggests an even earlier date than the man's request.
C. On the 8th of June. - This matches exactly with the date the man mentioned.
Since the correct answer must align with the man's initial request, the correct choice is:
C. On the 8th of June.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. On the 8th of June.

Q: dialogue:             W: Hi, Jack, I just came back yesterday. Anything new while I was away? M: Congratulations, Susan! It's said you will be promoted to manager and become my immediate boss.             question:             What's most probably the relationship between the two speakers at the moment?             options:             A. Colleagues. B. Employee and boss. C. Customer and salesman.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most likely relationship between the two speakers, we should analyze the dialogue given in the question.
1. **Contextual Clues:**
   - The conversation begins with a casual and friendly greeting. Susan (W) asks Jack (M) if anything happened while she was away, which suggests a collegial relationship where they stay updated on work-related matters.
   - Jack responds by congratulating Susan on her upcoming promotion, indicating a professional relationship.
   - He specifies that Susan will become his immediate boss once she is promoted.
2. **Analyzing the Options:**
   - **Option A: Colleagues.** 
     - Currently, they are likely colleagues. Susan is going to be promoted, which means they currently work in similar or overlapping roles, and she has not yet assumed the role of boss.
   - **Option B: Employee and boss.**
     - This scenario will become true once Susan officially takes on the managerial role, but it is not the current situation according to the dialogue.
   - **Option C: Customer and salesman.**
     - This option does not fit the context of the conversation, as it involves professional roles that typically do not include discussions of workplace promotions and boss-subordinate relationships.
3. **Conclusion:**

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Colleagues.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to extract the relevant information from the dialogue provided:
1. In the dialogue, F asks: "Where is the exhibition been held?"
2. M responds with: "Main Street. No. 16."
Now, let's compare M's response with the options given:
- Option A: Main Street. No. 6.
- Option B: Main Street. No. 16.
- Option C: Main Street. No. 60.

W: Well, I studied the piano for about three months but that was 6 years ago. M: That's good. So we needn't start right from the beginning again. W: When can I take lessons and how much do they cost? M: Well, that depends on you. We have a small group that meets on Monday and Wednesday evenings for two hours, that costs $4 an hour.

W: I'm afraid that I can't make it on Mondays but I can come on Wednesdays.             question:             Who suggested the woman call the man?             options:             A. Her friend's son. B. Her son. C. Her friend.
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question "Who suggested the woman call the man?", we need to refer back to the initial part of the dialogue where the woman introduces herself and mentions how she found out about the guitar teacher.
The dialogue starts with:  
W: "Hi, my name is Christa and I have a friend Mary, whose son is taking guitar lessons from you, and she suggested I call you."
From this, we can see that it was Christa's friend Mary who suggested that she call the guitar instructor. This is clearly stated in the line: "and she suggested I call you."
Now, let's look at the options provided:
A. Her friend's son.  
B. Her son.  
C. Her friend.
Based on the dialogue, the correct answer is:
C. Her friend.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Her friend.

She has very little. B. She doesn't have any. C. She's studied the piano for six years.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the woman's musical experience, we need to consider the information given in the dialogue. 
1. The woman says that she studied the piano.
2. She specifies that her piano study lasted for about three months.
3. She mentions that this experience occurred six years ago.
From this information:
- It is clear that the woman has some musical experience as she has studied the piano.
- However, her experience is limited to a short duration (three months) and was a long time ago (six years ago).
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. She has very little. - This option aligns with the fact that her experience is limited to only three months of piano study. 
B. She doesn't have any. - This option is incorrect because she explicitly mentioned having studied the piano.
C. She's studied the piano for six years. - This option is incorrect as she only studied for three months.
Given these evaluations, the most accurate choice is:
A. She has very little.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. She has very little.

The private lesson on Tuesday. B. The group class on Monday. C. The group class on Wednesday.
A: Let's think step by step.
The woman is interested in taking guitar lessons. The instructor offers two options for lessons: a group class and private lessons. 
1. **Group Class**: 
   - Meets on Monday and Wednesday evenings for two hours.
   - Costs $4 an hour.
2. **Private Lessons**: 
   - Held on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
   - Costs $8 an hour.
The woman mentions she cannot attend lessons on Mondays but can attend on Wednesdays. Based on this information:
- The private lessons are not an option because they do not fit her available schedule (Wednesdays).
- The group class on Monday is not an option since she stated she cannot attend on Mondays.
- The group class on Wednesday is an option and aligns with her stated availability.
So, the lesson the woman wants to attend is the group class on Wednesday.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. The group class on Wednesday.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. The group class on Wednesday.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the two speakers are, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Content of the Conversation**:
   - The male speaker (M) asks about the cost of sending an airmail letter to Japan. This suggests they are in a place where postal services are offered.
   - The female speaker (W) responds that she will have to check the cost, which implies access to postal rate information.
   - The male speaker then requests a 20-cent stamp, and the female speaker provides it. This indicates a transaction involving postal items.
2. **Location Options**:
   - **A. In a bookstore**: Bookstores typically do not sell stamps or provide information about mailing letters via airmail. Therefore, this location is unlikely.
   - **B. At a post office**: Post offices are the most likely location where one could inquire about mailing costs, purchase stamps, and handle postal transactions.
   - **C. On a bus**: A bus is not a place where postal services like buying stamps or asking about airmail costs would be conducted.
Therefore, the most logical location for this dialogue is option **B. At a post office**.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. At a post office.

The man should buy a car of his own. B. The man needn't go shopping every week. C. She will drive the man to the supermarket.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman means, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **The man's request**: The man asks if he can borrow the woman's car to go grocery shopping. He mentions that supermarkets outside the city are cheaper and offers to pick up anything she needs.
2. **The woman's response**: The woman expresses her reluctance to let anyone else drive her car ("I don't like to let anyone else drive my car"). 
3. **Her solution**: She suggests an alternative by saying, "Tell you what, why don't we go together?"
Based on her response, the woman is not willing to lend her car, but she offers to go to the supermarket with the man instead. She implies that she will drive instead of allowing him to use her car by suggesting they go together.
Now, let's analyze the options:
A. The man should buy a car of his own.  
- This option is not supported by the dialogue. The woman doesn't suggest or imply that the man needs to get his own car.
B. The man needn't go shopping every week.  
- This option is also not relevant to the conversation. The woman's response doesn't address the frequency of shopping trips.
C. She will drive the man to the supermarket.  
-

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. She will drive the man to the supermarket. This option aligns with the woman's suggestion to go together, implying that she will drive.

He always makes reservations for dinner. B. He always finds good places to eat. C. He read a book while he was eating dinner.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman says about John, let's analyze the dialogue:
1. **M's statement**: "John sure knows some good places to eat, doesn't he?"
   - This statement suggests that John is known for finding good restaurants.
2. **W's response**: "Yeah, when it comes to finding great restaurants, John could write a book."
   - The woman's response emphasizes John's skill or expertise in finding great restaurants. She suggests that his knowledge is extensive enough that he "could write a book" about it, which is typically an expression used to indicate someone is very knowledgeable or skilled in a particular area.
Now, let's evaluate the options given:
A. **He always makes reservations for dinner.**
   - There is no mention in the dialogue about John making reservations. The focus is on John's ability to find good restaurants.
B. **He always finds good places to eat.**
   - This matches what the woman implies. Her statement about John knowing great restaurants and being able to write a book aligns with John always finding good places to eat.
C. **He read a book while he was eating dinner.**
   - This does not relate to the context of the dialogue. There is no mention of John reading a book while eating.
Thus

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. He always finds good places to eat.

He is buying plane tickets to Europe.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man is doing, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. The man (M) asks the woman (W) a specific question about the cost of sending a postcard by airmail to Europe.
   - This indicates he is interested in sending mail, specifically a postcard, to Europe.
2. The woman (W) replies that it costs twenty-five cents.
   - She provides the information that the man was seeking regarding postage.
3. The man then states that he would like two 25-cent stamps, please.
   - This indicates that the man is purchasing stamps. This is a likely preparatory action for sending mail.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
A. He is sending some postcards.
   - This option suggests an action he is preparing for. While he is in the process that leads to sending postcards, he is actually purchasing stamps at this moment.
B. He is asking about his mail.
   - His inquiry was about the cost of sending mail, not about receiving or discussing existing mail he possesses. Therefore, this doesn't accurately describe the man's action in the dialogue.
C. He is buying plane tickets to Europe.
   - This option is unrelated to the dialogue. The man is asking about postage and purchasing stamps, not

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the woman wants to drink, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. The woman (W) speaks first and says, "I'll have a glass of wine please, and my friend will have a beer."
   - Here, the woman explicitly states that she will have a glass of wine.
2. The man (M) asks, "Would you like them now or during your meal?"
   - The man is inquiring about when she and her friend would like their drinks to be served.
3. The woman (W) responds, "Bring them to us now, please."
   - She requests that both drinks be brought to them immediately.
From the dialogue, it's clear that the woman's drink of choice is wine, as she specifically states, "I'll have a glass of wine please."
Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option C: Wine.

In a bank. B. In a store. C. On the bus.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the speakers are, let's analyze the dialogue and the context provided:
1. **W's Request:** The woman (W) asks for change for a dollar. This is a common request when needing coins instead of a bill.
2. **M's Response:** The man (M) replies that he can only give change if she buys something, indicating an exchange policy based on purchase.
3. **Policy Reference:** M mentions, "I don't make the rules," suggesting that he works somewhere with specific guidelines about transactions.
Now, let's evaluate the options:
- **A. In a bank:** Banks are generally willing to provide change for cash transactions without requiring a purchase. The reference to needing a purchase doesn't fit a bank's typical operations.
- **B. In a store:** Stores often have policies whereby they provide change primarily as part of transactions and might have policies requiring purchases for change for customers who are not buying anything.
- **C. On the bus:** Bus drivers typically handle payments for fares and might have limited change but are not typically involved in purchases of goods, thus unlikely to have a "purchase rule."
Considering the dialogue and the context about needing a purchase to get change, the most logical location for the conversation, where such a rule would be in

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. In a store.

She talked with the consultant about the new program until two. B. She would talk to the consultant during lunch. C. She couldn't talk to the consultant before two.
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what the woman means, let's break down the dialogue:
1. **The Man's Question**: "By the way, Jane, did you talk to the consultant about our health program?"
   - The man is asking if the woman, Jane, has already spoken with the consultant regarding the health program.
2. **The Woman's Response**: "I contacted his office, but his secretary said he would be out for lunch until two."
   - Jane indicates that she attempted to contact the consultant by reaching out to his office.
   - She was informed by the secretary that the consultant would be unavailable because he is out for lunch until two.
Now, let's evaluate the options based on the woman's response:
A. She talked with the consultant about the new program until two.
   - This option is incorrect. Jane did not actually speak with the consultant. She only attempted to contact him and was informed by the secretary that he was out.
B. She would talk to the consultant during lunch.
   - This option is incorrect. Jane does not suggest that she will be speaking to the consultant during lunch. In fact, the consultant is unavailable during lunch.
C. She couldn't talk to the consultant before two.
   - This option correctly captures the situation. Jane's

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the movie theater is located, let's consider the directions given by Ranae to Steve.
1. Steve needs to drive west on 1st Street, cross the river, and continue straight until he reaches Pine Street.
2. Upon reaching Pine Street, he needs to turn left.
3. The movie theater is the second building on the right after turning left on Pine Street. It is next to the church.
Based on these directions, the movie theater is located at the second building on the right on Pine Street after crossing 1st Street and the river.
Now, let's consider the options provided and choose the one most appropriate to the position of the theater:
- A. 1

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the location of the restaurant, let's retrace the directions given by Ranae in the dialogue:
1. Starting point is the movie theater: "Starting from the movie theater, go south on Pine Street, cross 2nd Street, and drive to 3rd Street."
2. Turn left on 3rd Street and drive east: "You'll see a parking lot on the left side of the street. Then turn left on 3rd Street and drive east."
3. The restaurant location: "The Pink Flamingo is the building just before the river on the left side."
Unfortunately, the original dialogue does not contain numerical addresses or specific numeric indicators directly related to A, B, C, and numbers provided (11, 14, 6). Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the answer from the text alone. If more specific context (such as a map or specific street number) links to these options, that could help, but based on the given dialogue alone, there isn't sufficient information to assign A, B, or C to the restaurant's location.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is not determinable based on the information provided in the dialogue. The dialogue gives a description of how to reach the restaurant but does not provide any numeric addresses or additional

To determine what time the restaurant closes on Sundays, we need to consider the information provided about its hours of operation. According to Ranae, the restaurant, The Pink Flamingo, stays open until midnight on the weekends. Sunday is typically considered part of the weekend. Therefore, based on the information given, the restaurant closes at 12:00 AM on Sundays.
Hence, the correct option is C. 12:00 AM.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the location of the florist, let's go through the dialogue step by step.
1. Steve mentions that he needs to buy flowers to celebrate Jennifer's birthday.
2. He asks Ranae where he can buy some flowers.
3. Ranae responds by mentioning the florist's location: "Well the only florist I know is in front of the stadium on 2nd Street."
Based on Ranae's response, we know that the florist is located in front of the stadium on 2nd Street. However, the options given (A. 10 B. 15 C. 6) are not related to any specific detail mentioned about the florist's location in the dialogue. It seems there has been an error, and the information about "10, 15, or 6" does not correspond to any meaningful detail from the provided text regarding the florist's location.
Thus, without additional context or a clear mapping of these options to the location, we can't precisely choose an option from A, B, or C. The key takeaway is that the florist is in front of the stadium on 2nd Street.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is not ascertainable based on the given dialogue. The options provided (A. 10, B. 15, C. 6) do not correspond to

Q: dialogue:             W: Can't you knock on the door before you enter my office next time? M: Sorry! It's just that I'm in such a hurry.             question:             How did the woman feel about the man?             options:             A. Disappointed. B. Annoyed. C. Sorry.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how the woman felt about the man, we need to analyze the dialogue:
1. **W's Request**: The woman (W) asks, "Can't you knock on the door before you enter my office next time?" This suggests that she expects the man (M) to exhibit a certain level of courtesy by knocking before entering her office. Her question indicates that he didn't knock this time, leading to the implication that she was displeased with his behavior.
2. **W's Tone**: The woman's question, particularly the way it is phrased, likely carries a tone of irritation or frustration. By asking if he could knock "next time," she emphasizes that his current approach was not appropriate.
3. **M's Response**: The man apologizes by saying "Sorry" and explains that he was in a hurry. While this may lessen the severity of the situation, it does not directly address the woman's feelings at the moment of his unannounced entry.
Considering these points, the woman's feelings are more aligned with being annoyed due to the unexpected and perhaps unwelcome interruption without the courtesy of knocking.
Therefore, the best option to describe how the woman felt is:
B. Annoyed.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Annoyed.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to review the provided dialogue between M and F:
M: Where did you find your book?  
F: I found it under my bed.
From this exchange, we can see that F (the female speaker) says she found her book "under my bed."
Now let's look at the question:
Where did she found her book?
The available options are:
A. Under her desk.  
B. Under her bed.  
C. On her bed.
Referring back to the dialogue, F specifically states she found the book "under my bed."
Thus, the correct answer is:
B. Under her bed.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Under her bed.

They are husband and wife. C. They are father and daughter.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the relationship between the man and the woman, let's break down the dialogue piece by piece:
1. **Dialogue Context**: 
   - F says, "Mike, have you seen little Franz? I can't find him anywhere!"
   - M responds, "Don't worry, dear. Our son won't go too far."
2. **Key Phrases and Words**:
   - F refers to "our son," indicating a shared parental relationship with M concerning "little Franz."
3. **Consider the Options**:
   - **Option A: They are brother and sister.** 
     - If they were siblings, they would likely refer to "little Franz" as "nephew" rather than "our son."
   - **Option B: They are husband and wife.**
     - Referring to Franz as "our son" strongly implies a marital or partnership relationship where they co-parent, which is consistent with a husband and wife dynamic.
   - **Option C: They are father and daughter.**
     - If the relationship were father and daughter, the term "our son" wouldn't be appropriate when talking about Franz.
4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the use of "our son," the most logical relationship is that of a husband and

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. They are husband and wife.

The library closed earlier than he'd expected. C. The professor had chosen a mystery book for him instead.
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what the man means, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. **Context**: The woman (W) asks the man (M) if he was able to use the book that Dr. Nelson put on reserve for their homework. This implies there was an expectation that the book would be accessible.
2. **Man's Response**: The man responds by saying he wasn't able to use the book, mentioning, "It's a mystery to me why the library closed early."
3. **Inference**:
   - The man mentions the "library closed early," which directly suggests that his inability to use the book was due to the library's unexpected early closure.
   - The phrase "It's a mystery to me" indicates his surprise or confusion about the library's closing time.
4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A. The library no longer had the book on reserve.**: This option suggests the book was not available due to it being removed from reserve, but the man specifically mentions the library closure as the issue, not the availability of the book.
   - **B. The library closed earlier than he'd expected.**: This directly aligns with what the man stated. His comment indicates unexpected early closure is the reason he couldn't use the book

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. The library closed earlier than he'd expected.

After today's class. B. Tomorrow. C. During the man's class.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when the woman will discuss her class project with the man, let's review the dialogue and the options:
1. **Dialogue Analysis**:
   - The woman (W) approaches Professor Carson (M) to talk about her class project.
   - Professor Carson responds by saying he has a class in a few minutes.
   - He then suggests that she should come and see him during his office hours the next day.
2. **Understanding the Options**:
   - **Option A: After today's class** - This would not be possible because the professor has indicated he has a class shortly and did not offer to meet after the class.
   - **Option B: Tomorrow** - This aligns with Professor Carson's suggestion to meet during his office hours the next day.
   - **Option C: During the man's class** - This is unlikely because the professor is about to start his class, and it would not be appropriate to discuss the project during class time.
3. **Conclusion**:
    The professor suggested meeting during his office hours the next day. Therefore, the most logical time for the woman to discuss her class project with the man is tomorrow.
The correct option is B. Tomorrow.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Tomorrow.

A: Let's think step by step.
1. Understand the context: The dialogue is about Jane and Bob, with a focus on musical instruments.
2. Identify key information about Bob:
   - W: "Yeah. It's Bob that's worried about."
   - "He really wants to buy drums."
3. Analyze the concern:
   - Bob is worried because he thinks, "we spent all that money on the guitar and he has hardly used it."
4. Determine which instrument Bob currently has:
   - The statement that they "spent all that money on the guitar and he has hardly used it" implies that the guitar was purchased for Bob.
   - Since Bob is concerned about buying drums, but they are not mentioned as something he currently owns, it suggests he does not have them yet.
5. Conclusion:
   - Bob currently has A. A guitar.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. A guitar.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine where the car accident took place, let's review the dialogue carefully:
1. The man is initially worried about the car and wonders about Katie's whereabouts.
2. The woman clarifies that Katie was driving the car to pick up something from the store and should be home soon.

Q: dialogue:             Man: Honey. Do you know what time Katie will be home? Woman: Uh, she should be here any minute. She took the car to pick up something from the store. Man: Okay, I was just a little worried that ... Man, what was that? Oh, no. The car! She drove over the mailbox and hit a tree in the front yard. Ah, the car! Woman: Well, just don't stand there blabbing all day. Let's go out and see if Katie's okay. Man: Ah, my car. Woman: Honey, are you okay? Daughter: Oh, mom. I'm so sorry. I can't believe this is happening. Man: Oh, my car! Woman: Forget your car! Man: Driving with the cell phone. I know. Daughter: It wasn't that at all. Don't jump to conclusions. Man: Oh, yeah. Daughter: Dad ... uh, mom. It's not like that at all. I mean, as I was pulling into the driveway, something rolled from under the seat and got stuck under the brake pedal ... the gas pedal ... I, I don't know, and I couldn't stop the car. And then I accidentally hit the gas when I wanted to brake, and I hit the mailbox. Woman: Uh, I think I know what the problem was. Honey, did you put those golf balls away like I told you? The ones YOU put under the driver's seat ... the ones I told you would get in the way. Man: Man, I thought I got those. Daughter: Plus, Mom, the windshield wipers on the car didn't work, so I couldn't see very well in the rain. Woman: Didn't you get those fixed? Man: Uh, I've been meaning to get those repaired. Daughter: And mom. I was going to use the car this weekend to go camping with my friends, but now my plans are ruined. My friends are going to hate me. What am I going to do? Woman: Hon, yeah, what IS your daughter going to do? It appears that it's mainly your fault for the accident and that she's in such a jam. Man: My fault? Hey, why don't you just invite your friends over for pizza? I'll buy. Daughter: Mom, we've been planning this weekend for months. I need a car. Woman: Hon. Man: What? I mean, man, what a predicament! That's tough. Woman: I think what your dad is trying to say is that you can take his new Jeep. Daughter: Yeah, awesome. Man: What? Daughter: Yes! Man: Wait, not my new Jeep. I don't even have 500 miles on it. Daughter: Four-wheeling through the mud, over big rocks and in deep ruts in the road ... if there IS a road. Man: Ah. Woman: You love your daughter, don't you? Man: Ask me after she returns from the trip. Daughter: Ah, Dad. I'm going to call my friends to let them know of the good news. Thanks, Dad, I knew I could count on you. Man: Yeah, but make sure wrecking the car doesn't become a routine activity. Daughter: Dad!             question:             Which factor did NOT contribute to the accident?             options:             A. excessive speed B. some obstructions in the car C. a faulty car mechanism
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which factor did NOT contribute to the accident, let's examine the details of the dialogue:
1. **Obstructions in the car**: The daughter mentions that something rolled from under the seat and got stuck under the brake or gas pedal, which suggests that obstructions indeed contributed to the accident. The woman further raises the point about golf balls under the driver's seat, which confirms this factor.
2. **A faulty car mechanism**: The daughter also mentions that the windshield wipers did not work properly, impairing visibility in the rain. This suggests that a faulty car mechanism (specifically, the windshield wipers) contributed to the accident.
3. **Excessive speed**: The dialogue does not mention anything about driving at excessive speed. The accident seems to have occurred due to the obstructions and the inability to see well due to the faulty wipers, as the daughter describes losing control and accidentally hitting the gas when intending to brake.
Given these points, the factor that did NOT contribute to the accident is:
A. excessive speed

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. excessive speed

She wrecked her friend's car. B. She won't have a car to drive over the weekend. C. She doesn't have money to repair the car.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's break down the situation as presented in the dialogue:
1. **Context**: The discussion revolves around a car accident where the daughter drove over a mailbox and hit a tree. The father is initially concerned about the condition of his car, while the mother is more concerned about the daughter's safety.
2. **The Daughter's Reaction**: The daughter apologizes and explains that she didn't intend for the accident to happen. She explains that something rolled under the brake pedal, causing her to mistakenly hit the gas instead of the brake, and additionally mentions the malfunctioning windshield wipers.
3. **Why is the Daughter Upset?**: The daughter explicitly mentions that she was planning to use the car during the weekend to go camping with her friends. She expresses distress that her plans are ruined, emphasizing that she and her friends have been planning this trip for months, and she is concerned that they might be unhappy with her.
4. **Conclusion**: Based on her words and the context, the primary reason the daughter is upset is about her weekend plans being jeopardized due to the car accident, as she mentions her plans being ruined and her friends possibly hating her.
Given these points, the best option that reflects why the girl is really upset

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. She won't have a car to drive over the weekend.

He offers to help pay for the repairs. C. He suggests she invite friends over to eat.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine her dad's original solution to her predicament, let's break down the conversation and analyze the parts relevant to the question.
1. The daughter's problem arises because she wants to go camping with her friends, but the car is not in a condition to be used due to the accident.
2. The mother implies that it's mainly the father's fault because of the golf balls under the seat and the unmended windshield wipers, which contributed to the accident.
3. The father is asked, perhaps indirectly, what the daughter should do given the situation.
4. The father initially suggests inviting her friends over for pizza, offering to pay for it, as a solution.
Given these points, it is clear that the father's original solution to the daughter's predicament is to invite her friends over, which aligns with option C.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. He suggests she invite friends over to eat.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He suggests she invite friends over to eat.

The girl decides to go camping the following week instead. C. The girl invites friends over instead for a pizza party.
A: Let's think step by step.
To resolve this, we must analyze the dialogue and see how the situation concludes.
1. **Examining the Dialogue:**
   - The family discovers that the accident was caused by golf balls placed under the driver's seat and non-functional windshield wipers.
   - The daughter is upset because the accident seems to have jeopardized her camping plans with friends.
   - The mother suggests that the daughter can take her father's new Jeep, implying that the father should allow it to make up for the accident.
2. **Father’s Reaction:**
   - The father is initially reluctant to lend his new Jeep since it has less than 500 miles on it.
   - However, the mother insists, asking if the father loves his daughter, suggesting this is something he should do for her.
3. **Conclusion:**
   - Ultimately, the dialogue ends with the daughter expressing gratitude and indicating that she will inform her friends about the good news.
   - It is implied that the father agrees to let her take the Jeep, though he makes a humorous request to ensure that wrecking cars doesn't become habitual.
4. **Options Analysis:**
   - **A. The father reluctantly loans his car.** - This matches the outcome described in the dialogue.
   - **B. The girl

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. The father reluctantly loans his car.

Q: dialogue:             M: Do you want the same cut as last time? W: The same on the top, but I like it a little longer over the ears and on the back.             question:             What's the relationship between the two speakers?             options:             A. Hairdresser and customer. B. Visitors. C. Strangers.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the relationship between the two speakers, let's analyze the dialogue and the context it provides:
1. **Content of the Dialogue**: The conversation is about a haircut, with one speaker (M) asking if the other (W) wants the same cut as last time. This suggests that M has given W a haircut before, indicating a professional relationship related to hairdressing.
2. **Role of Each Speaker**:
   - **M (Speaker 1)**: Asking about the haircut style suggests M is the hair professional, likely a hairdresser or barber.
   - **W (Speaker 2)**: Describing preferences for a haircut indicates W is the customer receiving the service.
3. **Frequency or Prior Interaction**: The phrase "as last time" implies that this is not the first interaction between the two regarding a haircut, suggesting an ongoing relationship between a service provider (hairdresser) and a customer who returns for service.
4. **Context Consideration**: If M were simply a visitor or stranger, it would be unlikely for them to have previously cut W’s hair or have details about W's haircut preferences.
Given this step-by-step analysis, the most logical conclusion is:
**A. Hairdresser and customer.**

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Hairdresser and customer.

Q: dialogue:             W: Good morning, can I help you? M: Yes, I'd like to know something about the weather in New York this week. W: Well, it's fairly hot and there's much rain in the evenings. M: I see, thanks very much for your help.             question:             What's the weather like in New York these days?             options:             A. Windy B. Very hot C. A bit cold
A: Let's think step by step.
First, we need to extract the relevant information from the dialogue about the weather in New York this week. According to W's response, the weather is "fairly hot" and there is "much rain in the evenings."
Now, let's evaluate the provided options:
A. Windy: The dialogue does not mention anything about windy conditions, so this cannot be correct.
B. Very hot: The dialogue describes the weather as "fairly hot," which might be closer to "very hot" than the other options, but the exact term used is "fairly hot." However, as there is no exact match and among the options given, this seems like the closest potential match regarding temperature.
C. A bit cold: This directly contradicts the information given in the dialogue, where it is mentioned to be "fairly hot," so this cannot be correct.
Given the options, B. Very hot is the closest match to "fairly hot." Therefore, the best choice based on the given options is B. Very hot.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. Very hot.

The food is not cooked enough.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what M and W are talking about, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. M initiates the conversation by expressing a complaint. This sets the context that something is wrong or unsatisfactory.
2. M specifies the complaint by saying, "I don't believe the food is cooked enough." This statement clearly indicates that the issue is related to the cooking of the food, specifically that it is not cooked enough.
3. W responds by apologizing and offering to bring another serving. This response suggests acknowledgment of the issue raised by M, and an understanding that the problem is with the food's cooking.
Given this analysis, the conversation is about the food not being cooked enough. Therefore, the correct option is:
C. The food is not cooked enough.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. The food is not cooked enough.

Q: dialogue:             M: Do you still see the people we went to school with? W: I did for a while, I suppose, until I left university, but after that not really. M: Yeah, I've lost touch with most people as well, but I still see Pat occasionally. W: Oh, yes, how's she getting on? M: Okay. I suppose but she's had a rough time in the last few years. She got divorced. W: What, from Peter? M: Oh, of course. You knew him, didn't you? W: They seemed very close. What happened? M: Yes, they were. Oh, it was all fine until they decided to have children. I think she basically didn't want them, but he did. Well, she had two girls, one after the other, and that meant she had to give up work. W: Didn't she like being at home? M: I think she liked working better, but she felt she should be at home with the children. W: So what happened? M: It all happened very quickly. She rang me one day to say that Peter had left home. He had a new girlfriend. It was strange because he seemed so devoted to his children. They got divorced in a few months and he was married three days later. W: Did He take the children? M: No, that was the amazing thing. He seemed to have lost interest in all of them. W: Does Pat work? M: Oh, yes, she has to...             question:             Whom did the man and the woman talk about?             options:             A. Their schoolmates. B. Their children. C. Their neighbors.
A: Let's think step by step.
Step 1: Identify the main subject of the dialogue.
- The conversation revolves around the people the speakers knew from school, focusing specifically on Pat.
Step 2: Determine the context of the conversation.
- The dialogue begins with the speakers discussing whether they still keep in touch with former schoolmates. The man mentions that he occasionally sees someone named Pat, and the conversation shifts to discussing Pat's personal life.
Step 3: Examine what is being said about Pat.
- Pat is discussed in detail; her divorce, her family situation, and her work-life balance are highlighted. There is no mention of children or neighbors as a general topic.
Step 4: Relate this information to the given options.
- Option A: Their schoolmates. This option fits as Pat, a schoolmate, is the focus of the conversation.
- Option B: Their children. This is incorrect, as children are not the main subject.
- Option C: Their neighbors. This is incorrect, as neighbors are not discussed.
Final conclusion: The conversation is about their schoolmates, specifically Pat. Therefore, the answer is:
A. Their schoolmates.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is A. Their schoolmates.

Because Peter no longer cared for the children. B. Because Pat didn't want any children. C. Because Peter had a new girlfriend.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Peter and Pat got divorced according to the conversation, let's analyze the dialogue step by step:
1. The conversation begins with a discussion about maintaining contact with old schoolmates. M mentions still seeing Pat occasionally and then comments on her having had a rough time in recent years due to a divorce.
2. W inquires whether Pat's divorce was from Peter, and M confirms this, highlighting that Pat and Peter were previously very close.
3. The conversation reveals that conflict arose when they decided to have children. M indicates that while Peter wanted children, Pat basically did not want them. Despite this, Pat had two children and ended up leaving work to stay at home, which suggests potential personal dissatisfaction or compromise.
4. The key reason for the divorce, as stated by M, is that Peter had left Pat and their home due to having a new girlfriend. M describes this as "strange" because Peter had initially seemed devoted to his children.
5. It was further mentioned that Peter lost interest in both Pat and the children as he pursued his new relationship and remarried shortly after the divorce.
From this breakdown, the most direct reason given in the conversation for the divorce is that Peter had a new girlfriend, leading him to leave Pat. This aligns with option C

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. Because Peter had a new girlfriend.

W: Didn't she like being at home? M: I think she liked working better, but she felt she should be at home with the children. W: So what happened? M: It all happened very quickly. She rang me one day to say that Peter had left home. He had a new girlfriend. It was strange because he seemed so devoted to his children. They got divorced in a few months and he was married three days later. W: Did He take the children? M: No, that was the amazing thing. He seemed to have lost interest in all of them. W: Does Pat work? M: Oh, yes, she has to...             question:             How long did it take them to get divorced?             options:             A. A few months. B. A few years. C.

Q: dialogue:             M: Hey, Louise, I've got a used copy of our chemistry textbook for half price. W: I'm afraid you wasted your money, yours is the first edition, but we're supposed to be using the third edition.             question:             What has the man done?             options:             A. He has lost half of his money. B. He has edited three books. C. He has bought the wrong book.
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man has done, we should analyze the dialogue.
1. The man, referred to as "M," mentions that he has bought a used copy of their chemistry textbook for half price.
2. The woman, referred to as "W," responds by saying that the man's purchase is actually the first edition of the textbook, whereas they are supposed to be using the third edition.
Given this information, let's evaluate the options:
A. He has lost half of his money. - While the man did purchase a book for half price, this option doesn't specifically address the main issue, which is that he bought the wrong edition.
B. He has edited three books. - There's no indication in the dialogue that the man edited any books. This option is irrelevant to the situation.
C. He has bought the wrong book. - The dialogue clearly states that the man purchased the first edition when the required edition is the third. Therefore, he has indeed bought the wrong book.
Considering the dialogue and provided options, the correct answer is:
C. He has bought the wrong book.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is C. He has bought the wrong book.

Q: dialogue:             M: Hello, Milton Hotel Reservations. How may I assist you? W: Hi, I'm calling to make some changes to an existing reservation. M: Certainly. Do you have the reservation number? W: Sure, it's 219. M: That's a reservation for Sally Menkel. Is that right? W: Yes, that's right. I'd like to change the check-in date from September 15 to September 16. M: Certainly. I can make that change for you. Is that the only change? W: No, the check-out date will also change from the 23rd to the 24th. M: No problem. We have you arriving on the 16th of September and leaving the 24th of September - altogether, eight nights. Will there be anything else? W: Yes. Instead of a courtyard room, I'd like a room with a view, preferably on an upper floor. M: I can certainly change that for you, but there will be a change in the room rate. The new rate is $199 per night, instead of the original $179. W: That's OK. These are all the changes. Thank you very much. M: You're welcome. Have a nice day!             question:             Why does the woman make the call?             options:             A. To book a hotel room. B. To make changes to a reservation. C. To ask about the room service.
A: Let's think step by step.
1. The dialogue starts with the woman stating her purpose for calling: she mentions that she wants to make changes to an existing reservation. 
2. The conversation involves confirming the reservation details with a reservation number and making specific changes to the check-in and check-out dates.
3. The woman also requests a change in room type from a courtyard room to a room with a view on an upper floor, which involves a rate change.
4. At no point does the woman inquire about booking a new room or room service details.
Considering these points, the reason why the woman makes the call is to make alterations to her existing hotel reservation. 
Thus, the correct option is:
B. To make changes to a reservation.

Therefore, among A through C, the answer is B. To make changes to a reservation.
