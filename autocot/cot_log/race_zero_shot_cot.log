Q: article:             Last week I talked with some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects  they thought they had. Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised do find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without "outside help". "What kind of help is that?" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a   or family friend to help them out. "Surgery ," one replied. I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job . One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. "They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!" At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall! It seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting "perfection" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality. No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that "perfection" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.             question:             We can know from the passage that the author works as a_.             options:             ['A. doctor', 'B. model', 'C. teacher', 'D. reporter']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the author's profession, we need to focus on the clues given in the passage. \n1. The author mentioned talking with their students about job prospects after graduation.\n2. They mentioned teaching students who are training to be doctors.\nFrom these points, we can infer that the author is someone who teaches medical students. Let's examine the options:\n- A. Doctor: While the author teaches future doctors, this option implies that the author primarily practices medicine, which isn't directly supported by the passage.\n  \n- B. Model: The passage does not provide any indication that the author is a model.\n  \n- C. Teacher: The author discusses their interaction with students, indicating their role involves educating them. Given that they teach students training to be doctors, it's reasonable to conclude that the author is a teacher.\n- D. Reporter: There is no indication that the author is gathering information for news or reporting purposes.\nConsidering these points, the most logical conclusion is that the author works as a teacher. Therefore, the correct answer is:\nC. teacher The answer is C. teacher

It's focused on job prospects and employment.\n     \n   - **Option B: become a model**  \n     While becoming a model could involve cosmetic surgery, the context of the article does not indicate that the students want to become models.

Q: article:             YUZHOU, HENAN -An accident in a central China coal mine killed 21 miners Saturday and left another 16 trapped underground , the government said. The death rose to 26 Sunday morning as rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners who were still trapped underground, rescue headquarters said. Rescuers were battling to reach the 11 miners still trapped underground, but chances for them to survive were very slim, said Du Bo, deputy chief of the rescue headquarters. "Based upon past experience, the remaining 11 miners could be buried in coal dust, so the survival chances are frail," Du said. More than 2,500 tons of coal dust smothered  the pit after the gas leak , which hampered  the rescue, said Du. The gas outburst happened at 6:03 a.m. Saturday when 276 miners were working underground in the mine in Yuzhou City. A total of 239 workers escaped but 21 were found dead and 16 trapped. An initial  investigation showed that 173,500 cubic meters of gas leaked out in the accident. Liu Wenbin, a deputy chief engineer of the company that owns the mine, was in the pit  when the accident happened. He organized the escape. "At around 6 a.m., I felt there was something wrong with the airflow in the shaft, and one of the team captains told me he also felt it and had already reported the problem," said Liu The mine is owned by Pingyu Coal & Electric Co. Ltd., a company jointly established by four investors, including Zhong Ping Energy Chemical Group and China Power Investment Corp.             question:             What could be the best title for this passage?             options:             ['A. Death Toll Rises in an Accident in China', 'B. A Coal Mine Accident in Central China', 'C. An Accident in Central China', 'D. Coal Mine Accidents in China']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, we should consider the following steps:\n1. **Identify the Main Topic:**\n   The passage is focused on a specific accident that occurred in a coal mine located in central China, specifically in Yuzhou, Henan. The key details include the number of casualties and the ongoing rescue efforts.\n2. **Highlight Key Points:**\n   - The accident occurred at a coal mine in central China.\n   - Initially, 21 miners were killed with 16 trapped, and the death toll eventually rose to 26.\n   - The rescue efforts are ongoing, but chances of survival are slim for the trapped miners.\n   - The cause was a gas outburst in the mine.\n3. **Assess the Title Options:**\n   - **Option A:** "Death Toll Rises in an Accident in China" – This is accurate but slightly generic because it doesn't specify the type of accident.\n   - **Option B:** "A Coal Mine Accident in Central China" – This is specific and covers the main topic well, mentioning both the type and location of the accident.\n   - **Option C:** "An Accident in Central China" – This is too vague since it doesn't specify the type or context of the accident.\n   - ** The answer is Option B: "A Coal Mine Accident in Central China" – It accurately highlights both the type of accident and the specific location, making it the most suitable title

The miners trapped underground would be saved without difficulty', 'C. 16 miners trapped underground were still found alive waiting for the rescue', 'D. Until the next morning another 5 miners were found dead in this accident']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's go through the passage step by step:\n1. **Initial Fatalities and Trapped Miners**: \n   - The accident initially killed 21 miners and left another 16 trapped underground, as stated in the passage.\n2. **Updated Information by Next Morning**:\n   - By the next morning (Sunday), the death toll had risen to 26, which indicates that 5 more miners were confirmed dead since Saturday.\n3. **Remaining Trapped Miners**:\n   - Rescue teams were continuing their efforts to reach the 11 miners still trapped underground by Sunday morning. This implies that some of the initially trapped miners had either escaped, been rescued, or were found dead.\n4. **Chances of Survival**:\n   - Du Bo, the deputy chief of the rescue headquarters, mentioned that the chances of survival for the remaining trapped miners were very slim due to the conditions.\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n- **Option A**: "Of the 276 miners in the mine only 21 were dead until the next morning". \n  - This is incorrect because by the next morning, the death toll had risen to 26, not remained at 21.\n- **Option B**: "The miners trapped underground The answer is 'D. Until the next morning another 5 miners were found dead in this accident'. This option correctly reflects the information given in the passage that the death toll rose

Before the accident happened there was no sign of something wrong', 'D. When the accident happened one of the mine owners was in the pit']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is not true according to the article, let's examine each option carefully:\n- **A. The mine was owned by more than one company.** \n  The article states: "The mine is owned by Pingyu Coal & Electric Co. Ltd., a company jointly established by four investors." This implies that the mine was indeed owned collectively by more than one entity, as four investors were involved. Therefore, this statement is true.\n- **B. There was at least one more similar accident happening in Central China before.** \n  The article does not mention any past accidents similar to the one currently being reported, nor does it reference any previous incidents in Central China. Therefore, we have no information from the article to confirm the truth of this statement. For the purpose of this question, this means it could be considered false as there is no evidence provided to support it. However, this is still ambiguous without further information.\n- **C. Before the accident happened there was no sign of something wrong.** \n  The article mentions: "At around 6 a.m., I felt there was something wrong with the airflow in the shaft, and one of the team captains told me he also felt it and had already reported the problem," This statement in The answer is false.

Q: article:             Understanding the process of making career choices and managing your career is a basic life skill that everyone should understand. Your career decisions have such a profound effect on all aspects of your life. It's important to have the knowledge and resources needed to make smart, informed decisions. Whether you are looking for a new job, aiming to take the next step at your current job or planning your retirement options, you are making career decisions. Using good resources and the guidance of a career counselor can help you to make those decisions well. Many people mistakenly believe that choosing a career is a one-time event that happens some time in early adulthood. However, career management is actually a life-long process, and we continue to make consequential   career choices over the years. When people want to take action in their career, career management and job search are about so much more than writing a good resume. If you learn about and act on the following areas of career management, you'll be rewarded throughout your career. Your interests, abilities, values, personal needs and realities should all be taken into account in any career decision making process. You spend countless hours at work, and it impacts your life in so many ways; it makes sense that you should be fully informed before making such profound decisions. Do you know how many different career choices are available to you? Both The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (American) and The National Occupational Classification (Canadian) list well over 20,000 different job titles. So unless you've actively explored a variety of career options, there's a very good chance that there are great possibilities available to you, and you don't even realize they exist. Match your understanding of yourself with your understanding of possible career options. Once you have developed a good understanding of yourself, you will be able to combine that self-knowledge with your career and labor market research to determine potential careers that are a great fit for you. When you've made a well informed decision, then you're ready to make it happen. Making use of good career guidance and resources will help you to acquire the education, skills, and experience needed to get the job and learn and implement   effective job search strategies.

Q: article:             Astronauts on shorter shuttle missions often work very long days.  Tasks are scheduled so tightly that break times are often used to finish the day's work.  This type of schedule is far too demanding for long missions on the International  Space Station(ISS). ISS crewmembers usually live in space for at least a quarter of a year. They work five days on and two days off to _ the normal way they do things on Earth as much as possible. Weekends give the crew valuable time to rest and do a few hours of housework. They can communicate with family and friends by email , internet phone and through private video conferences. While astronauts cannot go to a baseball game or a movie in orbit, there are many familiar activities that they can still enjoy . Before a mission, the family and friends of each ISS crewmember put together a collection of family photos, messages, videos and reading material for the astronauts to look at when they will be floating 370 kilometers above the Earth. During their mission, the crew also receives care packages with CDs, books, magazines, photos and letters . And as from early 2010, the internet became available on the ISS , giving astronauts the chance to do some "web surfing "in their personal time. Besides relaxing with these more common entertainments, astronauts can simply enjoy the experience of living in space. Many astronauts say that one of the most relaxing things to do in space is to look out the window and stare at the universe and the Earth's vast land mass and oceans.             question:             Which of the following best describes the families of the astronauts on the ISS ?             options:             ['A. They are caring and thoughtful.', 'B. They are worried and upset.', 'C. They are impatient and annoyed.', 'D. They are excited and curious.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option best describes the families of the astronauts on the ISS, let's analyze the information provided in the article:\n1. **Astronauts' Families Prepare Collections:**\n   - The families and friends compile a collection of family photos, messages, videos, and reading material for the astronauts before their mission. This shows that they are considerate about the astronauts' well-being and are making an effort to provide comfort and a connection to home while they are in space.\n2. **Communications:** \n   - Astronauts can communicate with family and friends via email, internet phone, and private video conferences. This indicates ongoing support and a desire to maintain a connection with the astronauts.\n3. **Care Packages:**\n   - Families also send care packages to the astronauts, which include CDs, books, magazines, photos, and letters. This further underlines their thoughtfulness and understanding of the importance of mental well-being for astronauts in a challenging environment.\nGiven these points, the action of preparing collections, maintaining communication, and sending care packages all reflect a caring and thoughtful attitude from the families towards the astronauts. They are concerned about the astronauts' comfort and morale during their time in space.\nTherefore, the best option that describes the families of the astronauts on the ISS is:\n The answer is 'A. They are caring and thoughtful.'

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main focus of the passage, let's analyze each part step by step:\n1. **Work Schedule**: The passage initially discusses the demanding work schedules of astronauts on short shuttle missions, and how this is different for long missions on the International Space Station (ISS) where they have a more balanced work-rest schedule.\n2. **Rest and Communication**: It then describes how astronauts spend their time off. On weekends, they rest, do housework, and communicate with family and friends through various means such as emails, internet phones, and video conferences.\n3. **Personal Entertainment**: The passage explains that astronauts have entertainment packages from family and friends containing photos, messages, and reading materials. It mentions that astronauts can enjoy familiar activities and have internet access to do some "web surfing."\n4. **Enjoying Space**: Finally, the passage touches on the unique experience of living in space, like staring out the window at the universe, which many astronauts find relaxing.\nAfter evaluating the content, it is clear that the passage is primarily about how astronauts spend their free time in space and the various means of entertainment and relaxation available to them.\nTherefore, the correct option is:\nC. spend their free time in space. The answer is C. spend their free time in space.

Q: article:             Dogs have long been used to find explosives and drugs.Now,a new study shows that man's best friend can also help to find lung and breast cancer,researchers report in integrative Cancer Therapies.The findings show that trained ordinary household dogs can detect early--stage lung and breast cancers by smelling the breath samples of patients. Researchers have found that cancer cells send out molecules different from those of healthy ones,and that might be sensed by smell by the highly sensitive dog's nose. For the study,five dogs were trained by a professional instructor to respond differently to breath samples of healthy and cancer patients."The dogs learned to sit or lie down in front of cancer patient samples and to ignore control samples through the method of food reward," McCulloch explained. After a period of training,researchers tested the animals'ability to distinguish cancer patients from controls.The animals were given breath samples from 55 patients with lung cancer,3 1 with breast cancer and 83 healthy controls who were not included in the original training period. McCulloch's group found that the dogs were able to correctly distinguish the breath samples of cancer patients from those of the control subjects in about 90 percent of the cases.The dogs were also able to detecting early-stage lung and breast cancers. "These results show that there is hope for early detection,"McCulloch said.The re-searches are planning to conduct further studies on the breath composition of cancer patients to possibly design an electronic device that can do the dogs'job."A dog's nose is so powerful it can detect odors 10 000 to 100 000 times better than a human nose can.I hope people will be interested in doing this research,"McCulloch added,"It shows that there is definitely something out there."             question:             McCulloch and his group used_in their research.             options:             ['A. 10 dogs and 55 people', 'B. 5 dogs and 86 people', 'C. 10 dogs and 83 people', 'D. 5 dogs and 169 people']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we should evaluate the key elements of the article where it mentions the number of dogs and people involved in McCulloch's research.\n1. **Number of Dogs**: The article states that "five dogs were trained by a professional instructor...". This indicates that 5 dogs were used in the research.\n2. **Number of People**: The article further describes the breath samples obtained from participants for the study:\n   - 55 patients with lung cancer\n   - 31 patients with breast cancer\n   - 83 healthy controls\n   Summing up these numbers, we get:\n   - Total patients = 55 (lung cancer) + 31 (breast cancer) = 86 people with cancer\n   - Total participants = Total cancer patients (86) + Healthy controls (83) = 169 people\nThus, McCulloch and his group used 5 dogs and 169 people in their research. Therefore, the correct answer is:\nD. 5 dogs and 169 people The answer is D. 5 dogs and 169 people

A: Let's think step by step.
To infer the correct answer from the passage, let's go through the options and analyze them one by one:\n- **Option A: Dogs can smell signs of other cancers except the above two kinds.** \n  - The passage does not provide any information supporting that dogs can detect cancers other than lung and breast cancer. It only focuses on the study related to these two types.\n- **Option B: The final goal of the researchers is to design an electronic dog to detect cancer.**\n  - The passage mentions that researchers are planning further studies to possibly design an electronic device to detect cancer, similar to what dogs can do. Thus, the focus is on creating an electronic device rather than an "electronic dog."\n- **Option C: Dogs can detect odors 10,000 to 100,000 times better than humans can.**\n  - This is explicitly stated in the passage, which mentions that a dog's nose is powerful enough to detect odors 10,000 to 100,000 times better than a human nose.\n- **Option D: Dogs will soon be widely used to smell signs of cancers in hospitals.**\n  - The passage does not indicate that dogs will soon be widely used in hospitals for cancer detection. It discusses the study's findings and the future possibility The answer is **Option C: Dogs can detect odors 10,000 to 100,000 times better than humans can.**

A: Let's think step by step.
The article discusses a study where dogs were used to detect early-stage lung and breast cancers by smelling the breath samples of patients. The key focus is on how trained dogs can differentiate between cancer patients and healthy individuals based on smell, highlighting their potential role in early detection of cancer.\nWe'll evaluate each option as a potential title:\n- **A. Special Noses of Dogs**: While this option references the dogs' exceptional olfactory abilities, it does not specifically highlight their use in detecting cancer, which is the main focus of the article.\n- **B. Dogs and Cancer**: This title is relevant but quite broad. It doesn't precisely capture the main finding of the study, which is about dogs' ability to smell cancer.\n- **C. Dogs Smell Signs of Cancer**: This option directly addresses the main finding of the study: dogs' ability to smell cancer. It is specific and informative, making it a strong candidate for the best title.\n- **D. McCulloch'S New Discovery**: This option emphasizes the researcher's discovery but is vague and does not convey what the discovery is about. It misses the specificity regarding dogs and cancer detection.\nConsidering the specific findings and focus of the article, **C. Dogs Smell Signs of Cancer** is the The answer is option that best captures the primary focus of the study: dogs' ability to detect cancer through scent.

A: Let's think step by step.
To solve the question, we need to focus on the specific goals and activities of the Sibshops program mentioned in the article. Here's a breakdown of what is provided:\n1. **Sibshops (Ages 10-13) Purpose**: The Sibshops program is designed for siblings of children with challenges. The focus is on improving sibling relationships and whole family happiness.\n2. **Activities in Sibshops**: The program includes group activities and talk treatment ways. These elements are structured around the goal of fostering better sibling relationships and overall family happiness.\nNow, let's consider the options:\n- **A. meet with other peers**: While the program involves participation with other children (peers), this option is more about the interaction rather than the specific aim of Sibshops, which is focused on sibling relationships.\n- **B. solve your mental problem**: The article doesn't state that Sibshops is intended to solve individual mental problems. Instead, it's about relationship dynamics and family happiness.\n- **C. improve sibling relationships**: This directly aligns with the stated purpose of Sibshops, which aims to improve sibling relationships.\n- **D. think of healthy coping skills**: This seems more related to the Banana Splits program, where children learn coping skills related to family troubles The answer is C. improve sibling relationships

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true according to the four passages, let's evaluate each option.\nA. "They are all in the same place."\n- The location mentioned for "Sibshops" and "Banana Splits" is Hope Church, Wilton CT, but "Friends and Buddies" and "Club Saturday Swim" do not specify a location, so we cannot confirm they are all in the same place.\nB. "They are all free of charge."\n- Each program lists a fee structure, so this option is false.\nC. "They all hold activities each week."\n- "Friends and Buddies" is held 2 Fridays per month, not weekly. Therefore, this option is false.\nD. "They are all intended for children."\n- All programs are designed for children or teenagers, as indicated by the age ranges: "Friends and Buddies" (ages 12-18), "Club Saturday Swim" (ages 5-14), "Sibshops" (ages 10-13), and "Banana Splits" (ages 9-13).\nThe correct answer is:\nD.

Q: article:             Every time I lost a tooth I would put it under my pillow at night. The next morning I would wake up to find two coins replacing my tooth. Then I'd wonder about the tooth fairy all day. "Mom, where do you think the tooth fairy lives? What does she do with the teeth she collects?" My mom said she didn't know. She only knew that the tooth fairy took the tooth away while we were sleeping and left us some money under our pillow. But I wanted to find out. So I think it was a good thing that I would lose another tooth. The plan was to stay up all night and ask the tooth fairy when she showed up. That night I lay quietly in my bed, growing sleepy as the night went on. Moments later, I felt that someone was close to me. Through my half-opened eyes, I didn't see any feet, but I knew it was the tooth fairy. I watched her run around and fly right out of my room. She was wearing a shiny green dress. After she left, I immediately felt under my pillow. There were two coins. I had never even felt my pillow move. I wondered if she used magic. As I got older, I learned from my teachers that the tooth fairy didn't exist. It was just a mythical figure of early childhood. I kind of thought it was, but how could I see the tooth fairy fly that night? Then one night my mom came into my room to check on me. The moonlight was bright that night and it shone through my window right on her shiny green nightdress. Right then I knew deep down that my mom was the tooth fairy.             question:             As a young girl, the author   _  .             options:             ['A. was afraid of the tooth fairy', 'B. was interested in the tooth fairy', 'C. knew where the tooth fairy lived', 'D. doubted if the tooth fairy existed']
A: Let's think step by step.
The article describes the author's experiences and feelings related to the tooth fairy during her childhood. Here's how we can determine the correct option:\n- In the article, the author mentions that every time she lost a tooth, she would wonder about the tooth fairy, asking her mother questions like, "Where do you think the tooth fairy lives?" and "What does she do with the teeth she collects?" This curiosity and questioning indicate that the author was interested in the tooth fairy.\n- There's no evidence in the text that the author was afraid of the tooth fairy (Option A).\n- The author did not know where the tooth fairy lived; instead, she was curious about it and asked her mother questions (Option C).\n- Although the author eventually learned from her teachers that the tooth fairy was a mythical figure, as a young girl, the article mainly describes her curiosity and interest, rather than doubt about the tooth fairy's existence (Option D). The doubt appears to come later, as she matures and gains more information.\nGiven this evidence, the best option that reflects the author's feelings and thoughts as a young girl is:\nB. was interested in the tooth fairy The answer is B. was interested in the tooth fairy

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to consider the context provided in the article. The author mentions putting a tooth under the pillow and anticipating the tooth fairy's visit. The main reason the author is excited about losing another tooth is tied to the curiosity about the tooth fairy. Specifically:\n1. The author expresses a desire to learn more about the tooth fairy by directly interacting with her. This is evident when the author devises a plan to stay up all night to ask the tooth fairy questions when she arrives.\n2. The article indicates that the author is intrigued by the idea of discovering more about the tooth fairy, which suggests a desire to repeat the experience of encountering her.\n3. While receiving coins is part of the process, the primary motivation seems to be the belief and anticipation that the tooth fairy would come again, as seen in the plan to wait up all night.\nTherefore, combining these points, the author's intention aligns most closely with option D: she believed the tooth fairy would come again. The excitement about losing another tooth is mainly because of the continued belief and expectation of the tooth fairy's visit.\nThe correct answer is: \n**D. she believed the tooth fairy would come again**. The answer is **D. she believed the tooth fairy would come again**. The author was excited about losing another tooth because it provided another opportunity to encounter the tooth fairy,

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's analyze the situation described in the article:\n1. **Context**: The author describes a specific night when she plans to stay awake to see the tooth fairy. \n   \n2. **Feeling Someone Close**: The author mentions feeling someone close to her while she was lying in bed. \n3. **State of Awareness**: The author describes her state as having "half-opened eyes," which suggests she wasn't fully awake but also wasn't fully asleep. This indicates she was in a state of partial awareness.\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the author's eyes are only half open and she feels someone near her, she is likely in a state of being only half awake, caught between sleep and wakefulness.\nTherefore, the most appropriate option is:\n- **C. was only half awake**\nThis option best describes the state of the author when she sensed someone near her. The answer is C. was only half awake

Q: article:             One day an old woman was traveling alone in the mountains. Suddenly she saw something shining  in the stream. When she came close, she found it was a precious  stone. She put the stone into her bag and went on with her trip. The next day the old woman met a young man, who was also a traveler in the mountains. The young man looked very hungry, so the old woman opened her bag to share her food. The hungry traveler saw the precious stone and asked carefully, "The stone is beautiful. Would you like to give it to me?" "Sure. Why not?" the woman said, and handed the stone to him. The young man left happily with the stone. He knew it was worth enough to give him _ for a lifetime. But a few days later he came back to return the stone to the woman. "I've been thinking," he said. "I know how valuable the stone is, but I give it back and hope that you can give me something even more precious. Give me what you have within your bag." The woman opened her bag. It was almost empty. She looked at the young man and smiled, "I have nothing special in my bag, but I do have something precious -- the joy of giving!" The young man felt ashamed  and left silently.             question:             How did the young man find the precious stone?             options:             ['A. He found it in his food.', 'B. He dug it out in a valley.', "C. He saw it in the woman's bag.", 'D. He noticed it shining in the stream.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question of how the young man found the precious stone, we need to refer to the details in the article.\n1. The old woman found the precious stone shining in the stream and put it in her bag.\n2. The next day, she met a young man who was hungry, and she opened her bag to share her food with him.\n3. While she opened her bag, the young man saw the precious stone.\nBased on this information:\n- Option A: "He found it in his food." - This is incorrect because the stone was not found in food. The old woman found the stone in a stream, and it was with her when she offered to share her food.\n- Option B: "He dug it out in a valley." - This is incorrect as it was the old woman who initially found the stone in the stream, not the young man.\n- Option C: "He saw it in the woman's bag." - This is correct. The young man saw the precious stone in the woman's bag when she opened it to share her food with him.\n- Option D: "He noticed it shining in the stream." - This is incorrect. The young man did not notice the stone in the stream; the old woman did.\nTherefore, the The answer is C. He saw it in the woman's bag.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, let's consider the main themes and the message conveyed in the story:\n1. **Summary of the Passage**: An old woman finds a precious stone while traveling in the mountains and willingly gives it to a hungry young traveler. Later, the young man returns the stone, asking for something more precious. The woman explains that her joy comes from the act of giving, not from material possessions.\n2. **Identifying Key Theme**: The central theme of the passage is the value of generosity and the joy one derives from giving to others. The woman willingly parts with a valuable stone, demonstrating that her satisfaction comes from the act of giving rather than possessing something valuable.\n3. **Analyzing Title Options**:\n   - **A. A special stone**: This title focuses on the stone itself, which is not the main focus of the story. The stone serves as a medium to convey a deeper message.\n   - **B. The joy of giving**: This title directly reflects the key message of the passage, which is about the intrinsic joy and value the woman feels in giving to others.\n   - **C. A woman and a young man**: This is vague and does not highlight the main message or theme of the story The answer is B. The joy of giving

Q: article:             The $11 billion self-help industry is built on the idea that you should turn negative thoughts like "I never do anything right" into positive ones like "I can succeed." But was positive thinking advocate Norman Vincent Peale right? Is there power in positive thinking? Researchers in Canada just published a study in the journal Psychological Science that says trying to get people to think more positively can actually have the opposite effect: it can simply highlight how unhappy they are. The study's authors, Joanne Wood and John Lee of the University of Waterloo and Elaine Perunovic of the University of New Brunswick, begin by citing   older research showing that when people get feedback which they believe is overly positive, they actually feel worse, not better. If you tell your friend who is slow to learn that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ . In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written. In this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, "I am lovable." Those with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation  . In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts. The paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy   that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation   techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic viewpoint. Call it the power of negative thinking.             question:             According to the study of the Canadian researchers,   _  .             options:             ['A. positive thinking is not as powerful as negative thinking', 'B. encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people', "C. happy people can think positively while unhappy people can't", 'D. getting people to think positively can strengthen their confidence']
A: Let's think step by step.
The question asks us to determine what conclusion can be drawn from the study conducted by Canadian researchers, as described in the article.\nFirst, the article states that the $11 billion self-help industry is heavily based on the idea of transforming negative thoughts into positive ones. However, the researchers conducted a study that challenges this concept. They found that encouraging positive thinking can have adverse effects, particularly for those with low self-esteem. Specifically, the study concluded that trying to get people to think more positively might actually make them feel worse, not better, by highlighting their unhappiness.\nNext, the researchers, Joanne Wood, John Lee, and Elaine Perunovic, found that overly positive feedback can lead to individuals feeling worse. They cite previous research, including an experiment where participants felt worse after receiving praise they perceived as undeserved.\nIn their own study, they found that participants with low self-esteem felt worse after forced self-affirmations (repeatedly telling themselves "I am lovable"). This suggests that positive thinking, in this forced manner, did not uplift their mood, but rather had a negative effect compared to the control group that did not engage in positive self-affirmations.\nThe article concludes by suggesting newer forms of psychotherapy that embrace accepting negative thoughts instead of fighting them, which may be The answer is 'B. encouraging positive thinking may actually discourage people'.

Q: article:             She was 6 years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live. She insisted on talking to me. "I'm building," she said. "I see that. What is it?" I asked, not caring. "Oh, I don't know, I just like the feel of sand." That sounds good, I thought, and slipped off my shoes. A sandpiper   glided by. "My mom says sandpipers come to bring us joy." "Good-bye joy," I muttered   to myself, "Hello pain," and turned to walk on. I was depressed; my life seemed completely out of balance. "What's your name?" She wouldn't give up. "Robert," I answered. "Mine's Wendy... I'm 6. Why are you so quiet?" I turned to her and shouted: "Because my mother died!" "Oh," she said quietly, "then this is a bad day." "Yes," I said, "and yesterday and the day before and - oh, go away!" "Did it hurt?" she asked. "Did what hurt?" I was annoyed with her, with myself. "When she died?" "Of course it hurt!" I replied angrily, misunderstanding. A month after that, when I next went to the beach, she wasn't there. Feeling guilty, ashamed, I went up to the cottage and knocked at the door. A young woman answered. "Hello," I said. "I'm Robert Peterson. I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was." "Wendy died last week, Mr. Peterson. She had leukemia . Maybe she didn't tell you." I had to catch my breath, saying nothing. "She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days. But the last few weeks, she declined rapidly... "She left something for you... if only I could find it," she said. "Could you wait a moment while I look?" It was a drawing in bright color1s- a yellow beach, a blue sea, and a brown bird. Underneath was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY. I took Wendy's mother in my arms. "I'm so sorry," I muttered over and over, and we wept together. But then we looked at the picture of the sandpiper and slowly both of us began to smile, remembering the lesson that Wendy had left us. Even when life seems sad, joy can be found in the smallest of things. We should take time to seek out these little joys in life and live for the love that we have for each other.             question:             When he talked to Wendy, the author failed to understand that   _  .             options:             ['A. Wendy knew she was going to die', 'B. Wendy had no friends of her age', "C. Wendy didn't believe sandpipers could bring people joy", 'D. Wendy had no experience of losing a close family member']
A: Let's think step by step.
In this scenario, when the author, Robert, talked to Wendy, there was a moment where Wendy asked, "Did it hurt?" in reference to Robert mentioning his mother's death. Robert took this question as being about the physical aspect or emotional pain of losing someone, which annoyed him. However, based on the context provided later, Wendy might have been asking with a more profound understanding of mortality, perhaps because she was dealing with her own impending death due to leukemia. \nNow, let's consider each of the options:\n- **A. Wendy knew she was going to die:** This is a strong possibility because Wendy’s question "Did it hurt?" could imply that she was aware and contemplating her own mortality, possibly trying to understand what it would be like for herself and for those she would leave behind.\n- **B. Wendy had no friends of her age:** This doesn’t seem particularly relevant to the conversation they had or the failure of understanding on the author's part.\n- **C. Wendy didn't believe sandpipers could bring people joy:** The text suggests Wendy did believe sandpipers brought joy, as she mentioned this to Robert, saying, "My mom says sandpipers come to bring us joy."\n- **D. Wendy had no experience of losing a close family member The answer is the correct one is **A. Wendy knew she was going to die.** Wendy, being terminally ill, likely had an understanding of her situation, and

Q: article:             She was 6 years old when I first met her on the beach near where I live. She insisted on talking to me. "I'm building," she said. "I see that. What is it?" I asked, not caring. "Oh, I don't know, I just like the feel of sand." That sounds good, I thought, and slipped off my shoes. A sandpiper   glided by. "My mom says sandpipers come to bring us joy." "Good-bye joy," I muttered   to myself, "Hello pain," and turned to walk on. I was depressed; my life seemed completely out of balance. "What's your name?" She wouldn't give up. "Robert," I answered. "Mine's Wendy... I'm 6. Why are you so quiet?" I turned to her and shouted: "Because my mother died!" "Oh," she said quietly, "then this is a bad day." "Yes," I said, "and yesterday and the day before and - oh, go away!" "Did it hurt?" she asked. "Did what hurt?" I was annoyed with her, with myself. "When she died?" "Of course it hurt!" I replied angrily, misunderstanding. A month after that, when I next went to the beach, she wasn't there. Feeling guilty, ashamed, I went up to the cottage and knocked at the door. A young woman answered. "Hello," I said. "I'm Robert Peterson. I missed your little girl today and wondered where she was." "Wendy died last week, Mr. Peterson. She had leukemia . Maybe she didn't tell you." I had to catch my breath, saying nothing. "She seemed so much better here and had a lot of what she called happy days. But the last few weeks, she declined rapidly... "She left something for you... if only I could find it," she said. "Could you wait a moment while I look?" It was a drawing in bright color1s- a yellow beach, a blue sea, and a brown bird. Underneath was carefully printed: A SANDPIPER TO BRING YOU JOY. I took Wendy's mother in my arms. "I'm so sorry," I muttered over and over, and we wept together. But then we looked at the picture of the sandpiper and slowly both of us began to smile, remembering the lesson that Wendy had left us. Even when life seems sad, joy can be found in the smallest of things. We should take time to seek out these little joys in life and live for the love that we have for each other.             question:             The author felt guilty when he saw Wendy was not on the beach, because he didn't   _  .             options:             ['A. know the girl had a disease', 'B. treat the girl nicely a month ago', "C. attend the girl's funeral", 'D. keep his promise to meet the girl on the beach']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the author felt guilty when he saw Wendy was not on the beach, let's review the relevant events from the article:\n1. The author first met Wendy, a 6-year-old girl, on the beach when he was feeling depressed due to the loss of his mother.\n2. Wendy approached him, trying to engage him in conversation, but he was initially dismissive and frustrated, shouting at her due to his emotional pain.\n3. A month later, the author returned to the beach and noticed Wendy wasn't there. Realizing he might have been harsh during their previous encounter, he felt guilty.\n4. The author visited Wendy's cottage to inquire about her, only to learn from her mother that Wendy had passed away due to leukemia.\n5. The author and Wendy's mother wept together, and they found a drawing Wendy had left, which brought them a sense of joy and reflection.\nFrom this sequence of events, it becomes clear that the author felt guilty because he hadn't treated Wendy kindly during their interaction a month prior. Wendy's attempt to reach out to him was met with his irritation and shouting, which likely amplified his feelings of guilt upon learning about her illness and passing.\nThus, the correct answer is:\n**B. treat the girl nicely a month ago The answer is B. treat the girl nicely a month ago

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the man learned from the little girl, we should focus on the interaction and the overall message conveyed in the story.\n1. **Initial Encounter and Impressions**: The man meets Wendy, who seems to find joy in simple things, like playing with sand and watching sandpipers. Despite the man's initial indifference and personal sadness due to his mother's death, Wendy approaches him with an innocent and joyful outlook on life.\n2. **Wendy's Perspective**: Wendy talks about sandpipers bringing joy, indicating her appreciation for small, simple pleasures. This contrasts with Robert's outlook, as he is consumed by grief and unable to find happiness in the world around him.\n3. **Wendy's Death**: Despite her battle with leukemia, Wendy managed to find joy during her time at the beach. Her mother mentions that she had a lot of "happy days" and even prepared a drawing for Robert with a message about joy.\n4. **The Message**: The drawing and Wendy’s words serve as a poignant reminder that even in times of sadness, there are small joys to be found. Wendy teaches Robert that it's important to seek out these joys, regardless of life's hardships.\n5. **Conclusion**: The closing of the story emphasizes the idea of The answer is 'D. A person should enjoy each living day.' Wendy’s approach to life, even while facing her own illness, shows Robert that there is happiness to be found

Q: article:             An allowance is an important tool for teaching kids how to budget, save and make their own decisions. Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly. How large an allowance is appropriate? Experts say there is not right amount. Actual amounts differ from region to region, and from family to family. To set an appropriate allowance for your child, work up a weekly budget. Allow for entertainment expenditures such as movies and snacks. Next, include everyday expenses such as lunch money, bus fare, school supplies. "If you make the child responsible for these ' ills'," says Josephine Swanson, a consumer specialist, " he or she will learn to budget for necessary expenditures." Finally, add some extra money to make saving possible. If you can, keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends. A child whose purchasing power falls away below his peers' can feel left out. It can be tough, but avoid excusing your children when they make a mistake with their allowance. When Brooke Stephens was ten and growing up in Jacksonville, her mother gave her $5 a week, $1.75 of which was for bus fare and lunch." If you lose your money," Brooke's mother told her, "you walk home." One week the girl spent all her allowance in a candy store, then she called home for a ride. " Mom made me walk home," recalls Stephens, now a financial planner in Brooklyn. " At first I was angry. But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson. " Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily chores. Kids should help around the house not because they get paid for it but because they share responsibilities as members of a family. You might, however, pay a child for doing extra jobs at home, which can develop his or her initiative.             question:             Which of the following is the possible title of the passage?             options:             ["A. How to develop a child's initiative.", 'B. How to work up an amount of pocket money.', 'C. How to teach a child to save money.', 'D. How to teach a child about money.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most appropriate title for the passage, we need to understand the main idea and key points discussed in the text.\n1. **Main Theme**: The passage primarily discusses the importance of an allowance as a tool for teaching children about budgeting, saving, and making financial decisions. It emphasizes how children learn from managing their own money and from potential mistakes.\n2. **Details Explored**:\n   - The appropriate amount for an allowance varies depending on several factors.\n   - How to budget an allowance considering expenses for entertainment, daily necessities, and savings.\n   - The importance of keeping a child's allowance in line with their peers.\n   - Teaching children responsibility through examples, such as Brooke Stephens' experience.\n   - Not linking allowances to everyday chores but suggesting payment for extra tasks.\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - Option A: "How to develop a child's initiative." - While the article mentions developing initiative through extra chores, it is a minor point rather than the main focus.\n   - Option B: "How to work up an amount of pocket money." - This reflects a part of the passage but doesn’t encompass the broader educational goals of using allowance.\n   - Option C: "How to teach a child to save money." - Saving is mentioned The answer is Option D: "How to teach a child about money." - This option covers the comprehensive goal of the passage, which includes budgeting, saving, decision-making,

To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the passage:\n1. **Purpose of Allowance**: The passage suggests that an allowance is an important tool for teaching kids how to budget, save, and make their own decisions. This implies that the intended outcome of giving a child an allowance is to encourage financial responsibility.\n2. **Learning from Mistakes**: The passage emphasizes that children learn from their own mistakes when their dollars are lost or spent foolishly. This suggests that experiencing the consequences of poor financial decisions is part of the learning process.\n3. **Managing Essential Expenses**: By making children responsible for their everyday expenses, they are encouraged to budget for necessary expenditures, which tends to foster a sense of responsibility according to Josephine Swanson.\n4. **Example of Brooke Stephens**: In the anecdote about Brooke Stephens, she learned an important lesson about financial responsibility after spending her entire allowance on candy and having to walk home. This experience taught her to be more careful with money.\n5. **Allowance and Chores**: The article mentions that allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily chores but can be used as a way to teach initiative through payment for extra jobs.\nGiven this analysis, option C, "feel responsible and careful about money The answer is 'C. feel responsible and careful about money'. The passage suggests that providing an allowance is meant to teach children financial responsibility and careful money management, as they learn from

Here are the key points:\n1. **Importance of Allowance**: An allowance is a useful tool for teaching children how to manage their money, budget, save, and make decisions.\n2. **No Fixed Amount**: There isn't a specific right amount for an allowance. It can differ based on region and family circumstances.\n3. **Budgeting**: When setting an allowance, it's important to create a budget that accounts for entertainment, daily expenses, and includes some extra for savings.\n4. **Comparing with Peers**: It's suggested to keep a child's allowance in line with their peers to prevent feelings of exclusion.\n5. **Learning from Mistakes**: Allowing children to make mistakes with their own money can be an important learning experience.\n6. **Allowance and Chores**: It's advised that an allowance should not be directly tied to daily chores. Chores should be seen as part of family responsibilities. However, paying for extra jobs can promote initiative.\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n- **Option A**: "Paying children for their housework is no good." The passage suggests that paying for regular chores isn't recommended but doesn't outright say it's "no good The answer is A. "paying children for their housework is no good."

Worrisome thoughts are constantly occurring in their minds: what kind of impression am I making? Do they like me? Do I sound stupid? Am I wearing unattractive clothes? It is obvious that such uncomfortable feelings must affect people unfavorably. Adperson's self concept is reflected in the way he or she behaves and the way a person behaves affects other people's reactions.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the text and the options given:\n1. The passage discusses shyness and its impact on individuals. Specifically, it mentions that "Shy people are anxious and self-conscious," implying that shyness involves a high degree of self-awareness.\n2. The text also notes, "It is clear that, while self-awareness is a healthy quality, overdoing it is harmful." This statement suggests that self-awareness itself is positive, but excessive self-awareness, as seen in shy individuals, can be detrimental.\n3. With this context, let's evaluate the options:\n   - Option A: "harmful to people" - This does not align with the text, which suggests that self-awareness is not inherently harmful unless it is excessive.\n   - Option B: "a weak point of shy people" - While shyness involves excessive self-awareness, the text does not label self-awareness itself as a weakness.\n   - Option C: "the cause of unhappiness" - The text suggests that excessive self-awareness linked to shyness can cause unhappiness, but it doesn’t say self-awareness in general is the cause.\n   - Option D: "a good characteristic" - This aligns with the text's assertion that self-awareness is a healthy quality.\nThus, The answer is 'D. a good characteristic'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the shy people's reaction to praise, let's refer back to the key information provided in the article:\n1. **Sensitivity to praise**: The article states that shy people "find it difficult to be pleased by praises because they believe they are unworthy of praise." This suggests that they don't accept praise easily and question its sincerity.\n2. **Response to praise**: It provides an example of how a shy person might react to praise, saying, "A shy person may respond to a praise with a statement like this one: 'You're just saying that to make me feel good. I know it's not true.'" \nThis example clearly indicates that shy people tend to distrust praise, feeling that it is not genuine. They believe the praise is an effort to make them feel good rather than a true reflection of their worth.\nNow, let's evaluate the options provided:\n- **A. They are pleased by it**: This contradicts the article's indication that they find it difficult to be pleased by praises.\n- **B. They feel it is not true**: This aligns with the example given in the article; they feel the praise is insincere or untrue.\n- **C. They are very sensitive to it**: While they are sensitive to criticism and potentially The answer is B. They feel it is not true

A: Let's think step by step.
The passage discusses the negative impacts of shyness on individuals. It describes how shy people are anxious, self-conscious, and preoccupied with others' perceptions of them. Shyness is associated with low self-esteem, a need for reassurance, and difficulty accepting praise. These traits suggest that shyness can hinder personal development and lead to unfavorable interactions with others.\nThe passage mentions that a person's self-concept affects behavior and that behavior influences how others react. Shy individuals may struggle to reach their full potential due to these self-imposed limitations. The text also notes that shyness can be overcome with determination, implying that it is indeed a barrier that can be addressed.\nNow let's analyze the options:\n- Option A: "help us to live up to our full development" – The passage doesn't suggest that shyness helps us achieve full development; rather, it is an obstacle that needs to be overcome.\n- Option B: "enable us to understand ourselves better" – While self-awareness is mentioned as a healthy quality, excessive self-focus (as seen in shyness) is portrayed negatively and not linked to better self-understanding.\n- Option C: "block our chances for a successful life" – The passage suggests that shy people struggle with self-esteem and social interactions, potentially blocking their chances The answer is Option C: "block our chances for a successful life" – The passage indicates that shyness can negatively impact individuals by hindering their personal development and interactions with

Q: article:             A new Canada Prize for the Arts and Creativity could be in place by 2010, with large cash prizes for emerging   artists in dance, music, theatre and visual arts.  The prize is the idea of Tony Gagliano and David Pecaut, founders of the Luminato festival,who were able to convince the federal government to back it. The federal budget has allocated $25 million to support the awards open to emerging artists. The aim is to create a prize that has the prestige   of a Nobel Prize.     "When you think about the major prizes of the world ---- the Nobel Prize in Sweden,the Kyoto prizes in Japan or the Booker Prize in the U.K . --- they bring great honor and opportunity to the countries that award them," Pecaut said."The idea here is that every year,the Canada prizes will be awarded to the very best promising emerging artists around the world in those four fields. "     A jury   of international experts would judge the 12 finalists,who would come to Canada and perform or show their work in public to win the Canada prizes.The performances would be televised, allowing Canadians across the country to see it. The federal government liked the idea of such an international prize that would advance Canada's brand,draw tourists and arts professionals from around the world.For the Canadian arts community, one of the greatest challenges is connecting to that international arts world to come up with co-productions and foreign investment and touring chances.     A group is working toward establishing the prize by 2010,with potential for semi-final rounds to take place about the same time as the Vancouver Olympic Games."Thirty or forty years from now,the future outstanding dancers and performers will look back and say, 'I broke out on the world scene in Toronto -- that's where I was discovered.' "             question:             Why did David Pecaut have the idea of founding a new Ganada Prize?             options:             ['A. To enlarge the content of the Luminato festival.', "B. To advance Canada's honor and opportunities.", 'C. To consider his own benefits from the prize.', 'D. To make more Canadians get world prizes.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why David Pecaut had the idea of founding a new Canada Prize, let's consider the context and intentions behind the prize as outlined in the article:\n1. **Objective and Inspiration**:\n   - The Canada Prize aims to bring prestige similar to other world-renowned prizes like the Nobel Prize, Kyoto Prize, and Booker Prize.\n   - Pecaut's statement highlights the intention to bring "great honor and opportunity to the countries that award them."\n2. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - The prizes are intended to award promising emerging artists globally, elevating Canada's brand on the international stage.\n   - By attracting international attention, the prize can enhance Canada's cultural prestige and foster opportunities in the arts sector through international collaboration, tourism, and investment.\n3. **Distinctive Purpose**:\n   - The focus is on advancing Canada's reputation and opportunities in the arts realm, rather than specific benefits to Luminato festival or individual gain.\n   - It is about creating an international platform and connection, not solely about winning international prizes for Canadians.\nWith these considerations, the reason why David Pecaut founded the new Canada Prize aligns with advancing Canada's honor and opportunities. Therefore, the appropriate answer is:\n**B. To advance Canada's honor and opportunities.** The answer is **B. To advance Canada's honor and opportunities.**

The Nobel Prize in Arts', 'C. A Canada Prize for Arts', 'D. The Emerging Artists']
A: Let's think step by step.
The article discusses the establishment of a new prize in Canada, which aims to recognize and support emerging artists in various fields like dance, music, theatre, and visual arts. The prize is called the "Canada Prize for the Arts and Creativity," and its purpose is to become as prestigious as the Nobel Prize, bringing honor and opportunity to Canada. The idea is supported by the federal government, which has allocated funds for the prize. Therefore, the best title for the text should reflect the main idea of establishing this new prize. \nLet's evaluate the options:\n- Option A, "the Capital of the World in Arts," suggests a focus on a location and not specifically on the prize itself. It is too broad and not directly related to the primary topic.\n- Option B, "The Nobel Prize in Arts," implies a direct comparison with the Nobel Prize but without mentioning Canada. It can be misleading as it might suggest an existing prize rather than the creation of a new one.\n- Option C, "A Canada Prize for Arts," directly mentions the central theme of the article: the establishment of a Canada Prize for recognizing and promoting emerging artists.\n- Option D, "The Emerging Artists," shifts the focus to the artists themselves, but doesn't emphasize the introduction of the prize, which is the The answer is Option C: "A Canada Prize for Arts" is the best title for the text.

Q: article:             Looking good, feeling good Born to a model mom and a suit maker dad, fashion was actually in my blood. I always had a strong desire to dress in a certain way and to stand out from the crowd. I made my own toys when I was a young child and sewed my first skirt at just 10 years old. A friend's mother took one look at my skirt and told me that I should be a patternmaker. In high school I started making my own clothes, mostly changing other things because I never liked anything how it was when I bought it. During the last two years of school, I worked part-time for a small business that made hand-painted silk clothing and bags. The owner became the teacher who got me into design in the first place. Another useful bit of work experience then came when I worked at a showroom during fashion week and found it very exciting. From there I worked at a top clothing store while I got my business started. For my business I started out with the idea that everything I did would be hand-made and one-of-a-kind, specially made for one individual who hopefully had the same tastes as me. Every morning I jumped out of bed, went to my studio and worked on my projects. This just showed how enthusiastic I felt about my work. And at night I even dreamed of new designs! Fashion design is _ art. What I mean is that it's something close to you and something you can touch and feel, and actually interact with. My advice to any young person who wants to be a fashion designer is to get the basic skills early on, such as sewing and pattern-making. Even if you end up specializing, it's really important to understand all aspects of design in order to make high-quality clothes. Also, if you dream of having your own clothing line, the best thing to do is start wearing your clothes. You have to try and do this because that's the way you're going to develop something that's all yours and unlike anyone else's. I passionately believe that the right clothing can make people feel better and give them more confidence.             question:             When the author was in high school, she   _  .             options:             ['A. wore the latest fashions', 'B. was fond of hand-painted clothing', 'C. began to make clothes on her own', 'D. dressed in the same way as her classmates']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's carefully analyze the information provided in the article:\n1. **Background**: The author has a fashion-oriented family background. Her mother was a model, and her father was a suit maker. She had a desire to dress distinctively and began making herself stand out from a young age.\n2. **Early Experiences**: The author made her first skirt at age 10, and a friend's mother recognized her potential in patternmaking.\n3. **High School**: It is mentioned that in high school, the author "started making her own clothes, mostly changing other things because she never liked anything how it was when bought."\nBased on this information, the most relevant portion related to the author's experience in high school is her initiative to create her own clothing. This aligns directly with option 'C: began to make clothes on her own' and is supported by the statement that she "started making her own clothes" during that period.\nThus, the correct answer to the question is:\n**C. began to make clothes on her own** The answer is **C. began to make clothes on her own**

Q: article:             Microsoft just finished a three-month experiment operating an underwater data center.A server rack  with the power of about 300PCs was placed into a water-tight  steel container and lowered into the ocean off the coast of central California. The unusual experiment was launched because current data centers are unpleasantly inefficient.They're built where energy and land are cheap (not close to where people actually live).And they waste so much energy cooling their massive computers.The ocean can solve those problems.The cold ocean floor sufficiently cools the computing components inside the pod.And since most people live near the ocean,placing data centers under water could potentially increase the speed at which customers could access the information stored in Microsoft's cloud. The experiment was so successful that Microsoft operated the underwater data center for 75days longer than it had planned to.The next step is to get a larger pod,with about four times the computing power,under the ocean for testing.Unlike the first experiment,the next pod will also be equipped with turbines,which will transform the ocean's currents into electricity.It's not clear when,if ever,underwater data centers will become a possible product."Our first experiment was like dipping our pinkie toe in the water,and now we're going for the big toe,"said Lee,corporate vice president of Microsoft Research. Microsoft is still analyzing the environmental impacts of the study.Data centers are both hot and loud,which could have damaging effects on ocean life.Microsoft found that the noise its underwater data center produced was drowned out by nearby shrimp and crabs.The data centers are also built from recyclable materials,and Microsoft believes that the total carbon footprint of underwater data centers will be"dramatically lower"than current land-based centers. Given the growth in the cloud,industry analysts believe that most of the world's data centers have yet to be built.But building a data center takes at least two years-an  eternity in the fast-developing tech industry.As a result,Microsoft builds its data centers with the future in mind,installing far more computing power and space than it currently needs. Lee believes that going under water can shift the building of data centers from construction projects to manufacturing jobs."What if we could mass-produce these pods on an assembly line?"he thought."We could deliver a data center,from conception to operation,in 90days.That's dramatically different than what's happening today."             question:             What is the advantage of an underwater data center?             options:             ['A.

It can make information easily accessible to people.']
A: Let's think step by step.
When analyzing the article, it outlines several advantages of locating data centers underwater:\n1. **Cooling Efficiency**: The article mentions that current data centers waste a lot of energy cooling their massive computers, whereas the cold ocean floor can cool the computing components naturally and more efficiently. This corresponds to Option B: "It can cool computing components automatically."\n2. **Proximity to Users**: Since many people live near the ocean, placing data centers underwater could potentially increase the speed at which customers could access their information. This relates to Option C: "It can be built close to the place where people live." Furthermore, the fact that data is more easily accessible also aligns with Option D: "It can make information easily accessible to people."\nThe key advantages that stand out clearly are the improvements in cooling efficiency (Option B) and potentially increased speed of data access due to proximity to users (Option D).\nOption A, "It can be lowered to the ocean floor easily," is not mentioned as a significant advantage in the context of the article. While physically possible, it is not highlighted as a primary benefit.\nGiven this analysis, Option B: "It can cool computing components automatically." is a correct advantage, with Option D also relevant to the context but less directly mentioned than B.\n The answer is B. It can cool computing components automatically.

A: Let's think step by step.
To infer the correct option, we need to analyze the information provided in the article about underwater data centers.\nThe article discusses several aspects of underwater data centers:\n1. Cooling Efficiency: One of the main advantages mentioned is that the cold ocean floor naturally cools the computing components. This addresses the problem of energy wastage on cooling in traditional data centers.\n2. Environmental Impact: The article states that Microsoft is still analyzing the environmental impacts, but it highlights that the noise produced by the data centers is drowned out by nearby shrimp and crabs, which suggests little harm to ocean life. Also, it mentions that the data centers are built from recyclable materials and that Microsoft believes the total carbon footprint will be dramatically lower than land-based centers.\n3. Construction and Manufacturing: The text suggests the potential for mass-producing the pods on an assembly line, which would allow quick deployment within 90 days. This implies a shift from traditional construction projects to manufacturing jobs.\n4. There is no mention of underwater data centers changing the course of ocean currents. Instead, the next pod will use turbines to transform the ocean’s currents into electricity, implying the use of existing currents rather than altering them.\nConsidering these points, let's evaluate the options:\n- Option A: "cause little harm to the ocean life" The answer is Option A: "cause little harm to the ocean life." This inference is supported by the article's mention that the noise from the data centers is drowned out by

Q: article:             There was a king who gave his daughter a beautiful diamond necklace. The necklace was stolen and his people in the kingdom searched everywhere but could not find it. So the king asked to search for it and put a reward for$50,000 for anyone who found it. One day, a clerk was walking home along a river when he saw something shinning in the river and when he looked, he saw the diamond necklace. He decided to try and catch it to get the $50,000 reward. He put his hand in the river and tried to catch the necklace, but somehow missed it and didn't catch it. He took his hand out and looked again and the necklace was still there. He tried again. But strangely, he still missed the necklace! He came out and started walking away, feeling sad. Just then, an old man walking by saw him, and asked him what was the matter. The clerk didn't want to share the secret with him, thinking he might take the necklace for himself, so he refused to tell him anything. The old man could see this man was troubled. He again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tell anyone about it. The clerk told him about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing. The old man then told him that perhaps he should try looking upward, toward the branches of the tree, instead of in the river. The clerk looked up and true enough, the necklace was hanging on the branch of a tree. He had been trying to take a reflection of the real necklace all this time.             question:             The clerk tried to get the diamond necklace to   _  .             options:             ['A. make the king happy.', 'B. keep it for himself.', 'C. get the big reward.', 'D. sell it at a high price.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The story describes a scenario in which a clerk sees what he believes to be the king's missing diamond necklace in the river. Initially, he doesn't realize that it's actually a reflection of the necklace and not the real item. The critical piece of information given in the story is that the king put a reward of $50,000 for anyone who found the necklace. The clerk, upon seeing the reflection of the necklace in the river, decides to try and catch it with the intention of obtaining the $50,000 reward. This motivation is supported by the fact that he attempts multiple times to retrieve it, despite initially failing. Therefore, the correct option reflecting this is:\nC. get the big reward. The answer is C. get the big reward.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we'll analyze the scenario before the old man approached the clerk.\n1. **Scenario**: The article describes a situation where a clerk was repeatedly trying to retrieve a diamond necklace from the river but kept failing. After multiple unsuccessful attempts and missing the necklace, the clerk started walking away.\n2. **Emotional State**: It is mentioned that the clerk felt "sad" because he couldn't catch the necklace despite his efforts.\n3. **Context**: The clerk was unsuccessful in his attempts and was preparing to leave the area when the old man entered the scene and asked him what was wrong.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- **A. was searching in the water**: This is true earlier in the scenario when the clerk is attempting to retrieve the necklace. However, just before the old man speaks to the clerk, he is no longer searching because he has left the river’s edge and is walking away.\n  \n- **B. was trying to find help**: There is no evidence in the text that suggests the clerk was actively seeking help before the old man's intervention.\n- **C. felt rather tired**: The text does not specifically mention that the clerk felt tired.\n- **D. was not feeling good**: The text states The answer is that the clerk was feeling "sad." This generally fits with the idea of not feeling good after being unable to retrieve the necklace.

A beautiful diamond necklace', "B. A king's promise", 'C. A lucky young clerk', 'D. Changing the way of thinking']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage tells the story of a clerk who is trying to retrieve a diamond necklace, which he believes to be in a river. Despite his efforts, he repeatedly fails to grab it. An old man suggests that he looks up at the branches of a tree, and the clerk realizes that the necklace was never in the river, but was instead hanging on a tree branch, and what he was seeing was merely the reflection.\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n- **A. A beautiful diamond necklace**: This option focuses on the necklace itself but doesn't capture the essence of the lesson or the change in perspective that resolves the story.\n- **B. A king's promise**: This option might refer to the reward for the necklace, but it doesn't highlight the key events of the story, especially the realization and shift in perspective.\n- **C. A lucky young clerk**: While the clerk might seem lucky for having found the necklace hanging on the tree, luck isn't the central theme of the story. The story emphasizes understanding and perception more than luck.\n- **D. Changing the way of thinking**: This option reflects the critical moment in the story where the clerk's change in perspective (looking at the branches instead of the water) leads him to the solution. This captures The answer is 'D. Changing the way of thinking'.

Q: article:             The man who admitted to killing an Italian woman inside her East Harlem apartment said he was possessed by an "evil spell  ," police said Thursday.     Bakary Camara, 41, who once dated the murdered woman, penned his admission of guilt in a three-page letter folded in his pocket as he tried to kill himself after policemen burst into his home. Kelly, a policeman, said "He says that there was an evil spell that was cast on him." Camara, who was in stable condition at St. Barnabas Hospital, was later charged with the murder of Rita Morelli.     The 36-year-old woman was getting a degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College as she waited tables at Caffe Buon Gusto on the upper East Side, police said. Camara called 911 from a payphone after killing the lively Morelli on Nov. 23.     Her body was later found in her E. 120th St. home. She was hanged and had knife wounds to her throat and chest.     Policemen began dialing numbers from Morelli's cell phone and when Camara picked up, a detective recognized his voice as the man who called in the report of a dead body, police said. When officers went to Camara's home, he locked himself inside, forcing policemen to burst down the front door to catch him.     "He is standing there with a knife pointed at his chest," Kelly, a policeman, said. "He makes threatening statements as to the fact that he killed the woman. He then stabs himself in the chest." Camara, who told police he served six years in prison for robbery back in his native country, was still waiting to be charged with murder Thursday.     Morelli left her hometown of Spoltore, Italy, five years ago to fully experience the arts and music culture of the big city, her family said.             question:             The reason why Camara killed the woman was   _  .             options:             ["A. he didn't love her any more", "B. the passage didn't tell us clearly", 'C. he killed her by mistake', 'D. he loved her dearly']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the reason why Camara killed the woman, we need to refer closely to the details provided in the article. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n1. **Camara's Admission:**\n   - Camara admitted to killing the woman, Rita Morelli. This admission was in the form of a three-page letter he had with him.\n2. **Explanation Provided:**\n   - According to the article, Camara claimed he was possessed by an "evil spell." This indicates that he attributed his actions to being under some sort of influence, separate from his direct or logical motivations.\n3. **Lack of Details on Motive:**\n   - The article does not provide any specific information indicating that he killed her because he didn't love her anymore or that it was out of love. There is no mention of mistaken actions leading to her death either.\n4. **Options Evaluation:**\n   - **A. he didn't love her any more:** The passage gives no indication that a lack of love was the reason.\n   - **B. the passage didn't tell us clearly:** This option aligns with the information provided, as the article doesn't specify a clear, rational reason for the murder.\n   - **C. he killed her by mistake:** The details in the passage The answer is "B. the passage didn't tell us clearly."

Morelli and Camara are both Italians.', 'B. Camara will be sentenced to six years in prison.', 'C. Camara was once in prison for six years.', 'D. Camara was seriously wounded.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true based on the passage, let's evaluate each option:\n1. **A. Morelli and Camara are both Italians.**\n   - The passage states that Rita Morelli was an Italian woman. However, it does not say that Bakary Camara is Italian. In fact, the passage mentions that Camara served six years in prison back in his native country, but it does not identify the country as Italy.\n2. **B. Camara will be sentenced to six years in prison.**\n   - The passage does not mention any future sentencing for Camara. It only mentions that he was charged with murder and that he previously served six years in prison for robbery in his native country.\n3. **C. Camara was once in prison for six years.**\n   - The passage specifies that Camara told the police he served six years in prison for robbery in his native country. This statement is directly supported by the passage.\n4. **D. Camara was seriously wounded.**\n   - While Camara did stab himself in the chest, the passage states that he was in stable condition at the hospital. "Stable condition" implies that he was not seriously wounded at the time.\nBased on the evaluation, the statement that is The answer is C. Camara was once in prison for six years.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option, we need to analyze the details provided in the passage.\n1. **Camara was in his native country (Option A):**\n   - The passage states, "Camara, who told police he served six years in prison for robbery back in his native country." This does not imply that he is currently in his native country but only mentions his past. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n2. **"Evil spell" really works (Option B):**\n   - The passage mentions that Camara claimed he was possessed by an "evil spell" when he committed the murder. However, this is presented as a statement from Camara and not as a factual claim validated by the passage. Therefore, Option B is misleading and cannot be considered correct based solely on the provided information.\n3. **Camara and Morelli are husband and wife (Option C):**\n   - The passage indicates that Camara "once dated the murdered woman," implying that they had a past relationship, but there is no mention of them being married. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n4. **Camara and Morelli knew each other (Option D):**\n   - The passage clarifies that Camara once dated Morelli, indicating that they had a personal The answer is D.

To determine the correct answer, let's review the information provided in the article.\n1.

The article states that her body was found in her E. 120th St. home, not Camara's home.\n   \n2. The article states, "Morelli left her hometown of Spoltore, Italy, five years ago to fully experience the arts and music culture of the big city," which means option B, "She had stayed in the city for 5 years," is aligned with the text.\n3. The article mentions that Morelli "was getting a degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College," implying that she had not yet finished her degree, ruling out option C, "She had just finished her degree before she was killed."\n4. The article states that Camara called 911 from a payphone after he killed Morelli. There is no indication that Morelli called 911, ruling out option D, "She called 911 before she was killed."\nBased on the information given, the correct answer is:\nB.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what Camara did after killing the woman, we can examine the details provided in the article. According to the article:\n1. Camara admitted to killing the Italian woman.\n2. After committing the murder, he called 911 from a payphone to report the dead body.\n3. Later, when the police identified his voice and went to his home, he attempted to kill himself by stabbing his chest.\nConsidering these points, we can evaluate the options:\n- Option A: "He called to report a dead body." - This matches the action described in the article where Camara called 911 from a payphone after the murder.\n- Option B: "He called the hospital to save the woman." - There is no mention of Camara calling the hospital in the article.\n- Option C: "He regretted and tried to kill himself but failed." - While Camara did attempt suicide, the article indicates that he first called to report the body, making this action the secondary one following the reported killing.\n- Option D: "He called the police and was ready to be arrested." - There is no mention in the article of Camara being ready to be arrested; he actually tried to barricade himself inside.\nConsidering these options, the most accurate answer The answer is A. He called to report a dead body.

Q: article:             Many scientists today are convinced that life exists elsewhere in the universe---life probably much like that on our own planet. They reason in the following way.   As far as astronomers can determine, the entire universe is built of the same matter. They have no reason to doubt that matter obeys the same laws in every part of the universe. Therefore, it is reasonable to guess that other stars, with their own planets, were born in the same way as our own solar system. What we know of life on earth suggests that life will arise wherever the proper conditions exist.   Life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere. This eliminates  all those planets in the universe that are not about the same size and weight as the earth. A smaller planet would lose its atmosphere; a larger one would hold too much of it.   Life also requires a steady supply of heat and light. This eliminates double stars, or stars that flare up suddenly. Only single stars that are steady sources of heat and light like our sun would qualify.   Finally, life could evolve  only if the planet is just the right distance from its sun. With a weaker sun than our own, the planet would have to be closer to it. With a stronger sun, it would have to be farther away.   If we suppose that every star in the universe has a family of planets, then how many planets might support life? First, eliminate those stars that are not like our sun. Next eliminate most of their planets; they are either too far from or too close to their suns. Then eliminate all those planets which are not the same size and weight as the earth. Finally, remember that the proper conditions do not necessarily mean that life actually does exist on a planet. It may not have begun yet, or it may have already died out.   This process of elimination seems to leave very few planets on which earthlike life might be found. However, even if life could exist on only one planet in a million, there are so many billions of planets that this would still leave a vast number on which life could exist.             question:             The existence of life depends on all of the following factors EXCEPT   _  .             options:             ['A. the right amount of atmosphere', 'B. our own solar system', 'C. steady heat and light', 'D. the right distance from the sun']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the factor that is not necessary for the existence of life based on the article, we need to identify which factors are mentioned as requirements for life, and which are not.\n1. **The right amount of atmosphere**: The article mentions that life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere, as a smaller planet would lose its atmosphere and a larger one would hold too much of it. Therefore, this is a necessary factor.\n2. **Our own solar system**: The article discusses the potential for life elsewhere in the universe and does not suggest that life depends specifically on our own solar system. Thus, being part of our solar system is not a necessary factor for the existence of life.\n3. **Steady heat and light**: The article specifies that life requires a steady supply of heat and light, which means it eliminates double stars or stars that flare up suddenly. Therefore, this is a necessary factor.\n4. **The right distance from the sun**: The article explains that life could evolve only if the planet is just the right distance from its sun, depending on the sun's strength. Thus, this is also a necessary factor.\nBased on this analysis, the existence of life depends on all the factors listed except for **B. our own solar system The answer is B. our own solar system

Q: article:             Many scientists today are convinced that life exists elsewhere in the universe---life probably much like that on our own planet. They reason in the following way.   As far as astronomers can determine, the entire universe is built of the same matter. They have no reason to doubt that matter obeys the same laws in every part of the universe. Therefore, it is reasonable to guess that other stars, with their own planets, were born in the same way as our own solar system.

The distance between a planet and its sun should be right.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To address the question, we need to determine which statement is incorrect based on the information provided in the article.\n1. **Statement A: "The planet must be as big and heavy as the earth."**\n   - The article mentions that life requires the right amount and kind of atmosphere, which is dependent on the planet being about the same size and weight as Earth. Therefore, this statement is correct according to the article.\n2. **Statement B: "Proper conditions are essential to the existence of life."**\n   - The article emphasizes that life requires specific conditions, such as the right atmosphere, a steady supply of heat and light, and a suitable distance from the sun. Thus, this statement is correct as it aligns with the article.\n3. **Statement C: "Double stars can provide steady light and heat."**\n   - The article explicitly states that life requires a steady supply of heat and light, which eliminates double stars or stars that flare up suddenly. Therefore, double stars do not provide the steady conditions needed. This makes the statement incorrect according to the article.\n4. **Statement D: "The distance between a planet and its sun should be right."**\n   - The article describes that life could only evolve if the planet is just the right distance from its The answer is C. Double stars can provide steady light and heat.

Most of the planets of the stars.', 'B. Stars similar to our sun.', 'C. Planets similar to the earth.', 'D. Planets with proper conditions.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what kind of planet might NOT support life, we need to examine the criteria for a planet to potentially support life, as described in the article:\n1. **Atmosphere:** A planet must have the right amount and kind of atmosphere, similar in size and weight to Earth. Smaller planets would lose their atmosphere, and larger ones would have too dense an atmosphere.\n2. **Heat and Light:** A planet needs a steady supply of heat and light, which requires it to orbit a single star like our sun, ruling out double stars or stars that flare up suddenly.\n3. **Distance from Star:** The planet must be at the right distance from its star, similar to Earth's distance from the sun, to not be too hot or too cold.\nNow, let's go through the options:\n- **A. Most of the planets of the stars.**  \n  This option suggests that many planets do not meet the necessary criteria for supporting life, as they might not have the right conditions mentioned above. This aligns with the process of elimination described in the passage.\n- **B. Stars similar to our sun.**  \n  Stars are not planets, so this option is irrelevant.\n- **C. Planets similar to the earth.**  \n  This option suggests planets that The answer is likely have the right atmosphere, heat, light, and distance from their star, making them candidates to support life, so this is not correct.\n- **

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage and the options:\nThe passage discusses the reasoning of scientists who believe that life could exist elsewhere in the universe under conditions similar to those on Earth. The author goes through a process of elimination, suggesting several criteria that must be met for life to exist on other planets, such as the right atmosphere, size, distance from their sun, and a steady supply of heat and light.\nToward the end of the passage, the author acknowledges that this process of elimination seems to leave very few planets on which Earth-like life might be found. However, the passage concludes with the statement that even if life could exist on only one planet in a million, the vast number of planets in the universe would still mean that a large number of planets could support life.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- A. "it is impossible for life to exist on planets." This option contradicts the conclusion of the passage, which suggests that life could indeed exist on many planets.\n  \n- B. "earthlike life could only exist on a few planets." This option somewhat aligns with the elimination process described, but it doesn't capture the final suggestion that many planets could still potentially support life.\n- C. "life could exist on only one planet in a The answer is D. "life could exist on a great number of planets."

Q: article:             I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.             question:             The author thinks human cloning is wrong mainly for    _    reasons.             options:             ['A. 4', 'B. 3', 'C. 2', 'D. 5']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how many reasons the author thinks human cloning is wrong, we should identify the distinct reasons mentioned in the article:\n1. **Identity Concerns**: The author states that cloning could affect the clone's right to their own personality and genetic identity, suggesting that cloning may lead to identity struggles by assigning someone else's genetic identity to a person.\n2. **Power Struggle**: The article mentions a significant power and control concern, highlighting how cloning could give undue power to the person cloning, more than any parent might have over a child.\n3. **Embryo/Killing Concerns**: The text discusses the ethical issues linked to experiments and mentions the high failure rate with embryos, exemplified by Dolly the sheep, implying potential wastage and ethical concerns regarding the loss of life.\n4. **Physical Risk/Failure Rate**: The author also lists the dangers associated with cloning procedures, including high failure rates that can result in the death of birth mothers, as seen in animal studies.\nBased on the identified reasons: identity concerns, power struggle, ethical issues concerning embryos, and physical risks, there are four main reasons mentioned.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: \n**A. 4** The answer is A. 4

Cloning itself gives parents great power over identity.', "B. People's identity is completely determined by their genes.", "C. Government has the rights to confirm people's identities.", 'D. Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the author's opinion about identity in the context of the article, let's break down the relevant parts of the text.\n1. The author expresses concern about cloning affecting identity by stating: "What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity?"\n2. Further, it is mentioned: "True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities."\nFrom these statements, it is clear that the author is concerned that cloning could interfere with an individual's right to their own identity, as it involves replicating someone else's genetic identity.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- Option A: "Cloning itself gives parents great power over identity."\n  - This option focuses on power dynamics rather than directly addressing identity possession.\n  \n- Option B: "People's identity is completely determined by their genes."\n  - This option suggests a deterministic view of identity without acknowledging the individuality the author emphasizes.\n- Option C: "Government has the rights to confirm people's identities."\n  - This option is unrelated to the discussion presented in the article about identity through cloning.\n- Option D: "Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities."\n  - This option aligns with the text where the author specifically states concerns The answer is Option D: "Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities."

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, we need to carefully analyze Paragraph 4 of the given article. In Paragraph 4, the article discusses the risks and failure rates associated with cloning, using the example of Dolly the sheep. Key points from Paragraph 4 include:\n1. Dolly was the only successful clone out of over 200 sheep embryos; the rest either died or were discarded.\n2. There is a very high failure rate in cloning, as evidenced by the example of Dolly.\n3. Cloning at present poses significant risks related to failure and loss of embryos.\nNow let's evaluate each of the provided options:\n- Option A: "Human cloning is much more difficult than animal cloning." \n  While Paragraph 4 highlights the difficulties and high failure rates associated with cloning, it does not explicitly compare human cloning to animal cloning.\n- Option B: "There are 200 sheep successfully cloned."\n  This is incorrect according to Paragraph 4, since it states that only one sheep, Dolly, was successfully cloned, not 200.\n- Option C: "Cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort."\n  This is supported by Paragraph 4, which talks about running the risk of high failure rates and wasting embryos when cloning, indicating that a lot of effort could be The answer is Option C: "Cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort."

What Is Human Cloning', 'B. Human Cloning Is Wrong', 'C. How Does Human Cloning Happen', 'D. Discussion On Human Cloning']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage primarily argues against human cloning by highlighting several risks and ethical concerns associated with the practice. It discusses the dangers to the clone and the birth mother, the ethical issue of identity and rights, and the high failure rate observed in cloning experiments. The focus is clearly on presenting the viewpoint that human cloning is wrong due to these reasons. \nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- Option A, "What Is Human Cloning," suggests a descriptive or explanatory focus that is not aligned with the argument-driven nature of the passage.\n  \n- Option B, "Human Cloning Is Wrong," directly captures the main argument of the passage, which is centered on the various reasons why the author believes cloning is wrong.\n  \n- Option C, "How Does Human Cloning Happen," suggests a focus on the process of cloning, which is not covered in detail in the passage.\n  \n- Option D, "Discussion On Human Cloning," is more general and does not convey the specific stance the passage takes against cloning.\nTherefore, Option B, "Human Cloning Is Wrong," is the most appropriate title as it accurately reflects the thesis and main points of the passage.\nThe best title of the passage is "B. Human Cloning Is Wrong." The answer is B. Human Cloning Is Wrong.

Q: article:             As a teenager, Simon Weston wasn't particularly good at his studies, but he was a good football player. He could also be naughty sometimes so his mother decided Simon should join the army when he was sixteen to teach him some discipline . She was right; Simon really enjoyed army life and became a well-respected member. However, Simon's life was changed forever in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, which belong to Britain, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared war . Simon was on board a ship taking troops to the Falklands when it was attacked and set on fire. In an act of great heroism, Simon tried to save one of his friends from being burnt alive. Sadly, he failed and was seriously burnt himself. At the age of 21, Simon's life seemed over. Simon had 70 operations to rebuild his face and body. He was so badly burnt that his mother walked past him in the hospital without recognizing her son. Simon struggled to call out, "Mum, it's me, Simon." Hearing his voice, his mother broke down in tears. Many thought Simon would die, but to everyone's astonishment, he survived. Although he experienced terrible pain, Simon never gave up hope. After months of treatment, Simon slowly started to recover and, although he would be terribly scarred for the rest of his life, he was able to leave hospital. This was when _ . The physical pain slowly disappeared; however, the emotional pain became worse. Simon started to gout but was wounded by the stares of people who looked at him like he was some kind of freak . He felt like saying, "I wasn't born like this you know. I was injured defending my country." It took great courage for Simon to continue to go out. Eventually, Simon became involved in charity work and met his wife Lucy with whom he has three children. Life has never been the same for Simon but his Bravery is an example to us all.             question:             Simon's mother wanted him to join the army because   _  .             options:             ['A. he liked the life in the army', 'B. she wanted him to be fit', 'C. he was very good at playing sports', 'D. she felt it would change his behavior.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question about why Simon's mother wanted him to join the army, let's consider the details provided in the article:\n1. Simon wasn't particularly good at his studies and could be naughty sometimes.\n2. His mother specifically wanted him to join the army to teach him some discipline.\nThe primary motivation for his mother to consider the army for Simon was not because he was good at sports, needed fitness, or enjoyed army life (which Simon only realized after joining), but because she believed it would teach him discipline and likely change his behavior.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nD. She felt it would change his behavior. The answer is 'D. she felt it would change his behavior.'

Life has never been the same for Simon but his Bravery is an example to us all.             question:             What can we infer from the text about Simon?             options:             ['A. He succeeded in saving his friend in danger.', 'B. he became an excellent professional soldier.', "C. he didn't get along with other soldiers.", 'D. he found life in the army very terrible']
A: Let's think step by step.
To infer from the text about Simon, let's analyze each option in the context of the article's details:\n1. **A. He succeeded in saving his friend in danger.**\n   - The text states that Simon tried to save one of his friends but sadly failed and was severely burnt himself. This indicates that he did not succeed in saving his friend.\n2. **B. He became an excellent professional soldier.**\n   - The article mentions that Simon enjoyed army life and became a well-respected member, which can imply that he was successful in his military role and may indicate he was an excellent professional soldier.\n3. **C. he didn't get along with other soldiers.**\n   - There is no mention in the article about Simon having conflicts with other soldiers. On the contrary, his attempt to save a friend suggests camaraderie with his fellow soldiers.\n4. **D. he found life in the army very terrible.**\n   - The text does not indicate that Simon found army life terrible. In fact, it states that Simon enjoyed army life, so this option does not align with the information given.\nBased on the analysis, the most plausible inference is **B. he became an excellent professional soldier.** The answer is B. He became an excellent professional soldier.

Q: article:             As a teenager, Simon Weston wasn't particularly good at his studies, but he was a good football player. He could also be naughty sometimes so his mother decided Simon should join the army when he was sixteen to teach him some discipline . She was right; Simon really enjoyed army life and became a well-respected member. However, Simon's life was changed forever in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, which belong to Britain, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared war . Simon was on board a ship taking troops to the Falklands when it was attacked and set on fire. In an act of great heroism, Simon tried to save one of his friends from being burnt alive. Sadly, he failed and was seriously burnt himself. At the age of 21, Simon's life seemed over. Simon had 70 operations to rebuild his face and body. He was so badly burnt that his mother walked past him in the hospital without recognizing her son. Simon struggled to call out, "Mum, it's me, Simon." Hearing his voice, his mother broke down in tears. Many thought Simon would die, but to everyone's astonishment, he survived. Although he experienced terrible pain, Simon never gave up hope.

Aggressive and strong.', 'B. Calm and kind', 'C. Brave and generous', 'D. Strange and selfish.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option best describes Simon, we need to assess the key characteristics and actions presented in the article:\n1. **Aggressive and strong**: The article does not provide significant evidence of Simon being aggressive. While he was strong enough to undergo numerous surgeries and face immense challenges, "aggressive" does not capture his overall demeanor as described.\n2. **Calm and kind**: The article does not focus on Simon's calmness explicitly. Although he shows resilience, the text does not significantly highlight traits like calmness or kindness in a way that stands out as his defining characteristics.\n3. **Brave and generous**: Simon's bravery is a central theme in the article. He tried to save a friend during a life-threatening situation, underwent 70 surgeries, and continued to strive for a meaningful life despite his injuries. His involvement in charity work suggests generosity, as he contributes to the community and helps others.\n4. **Strange and selfish**: The article does not portray Simon as strange or selfish. In fact, his desire to save his friend and his participation in charity work indicate selflessness rather than selfishness.\nConsidering these points, the option that best describes Simon is **C. Brave and generous**. His actions and life story demonstrate significant bravery The answer is C. Brave and generous.

Q: article:             Our surroundings are being polluted faster than nature and man's present efforts cannot prevent it. Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities, and the growing use of man-made materials. What can explain and solve this problem? The fact is that pollution is caused by man--by his desire for a modern way of life. We make "increasing industrialization" our chief aim. So we are often ready to offer everything: clean air, pure water, good food, our health and the future of our children. There is a constant flow of people from the countryside into the cities, eager for the benefits of our modern society. But as our technological achievements have grown in the last twenty years, pollution has become a serious problem. Isn't it time we stopped to ask ourselves where we are going--and why? It makes one think of the story about the airline pilot who told his passengers over the loudspeaker, "I've some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we're making rapid progress at 530 miles per hour. The bad news is that we're lost and don't know where we're going." The sad fact is that this becomes a true story when spoken of our modern society.             question:             Man cannot prevent the world from being polluted mainly because  _  .             options:             ['A. the population of the world is decreasing fast', 'B. people use too many man-made materials', 'C. we have more and more industry', 'D. we are producing more cars, trucks and buses']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main reason why man cannot prevent the world from being polluted, we need to carefully consider the context provided in the article and assess the options given.\nThe article highlights several key points:\n1. "Our surroundings are being polluted faster than nature and man's present efforts cannot prevent it."\n2. The text mentions "more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities, and the growing use of man-made materials."\n3. It stresses that pollution is a result of man's desire for a modern way of life, with an emphasis on "increasing industrialization" being the chief aim.\n4. There's a critical statement suggesting we need to evaluate our progress and intentions, comparing it to an airline pilot making rapid, yet directionless, progress.\nNow, let's evaluate the given options in the context of these points:\n- Option A: "the population of the world is decreasing fast" – This option contradicts the article, which suggests an increase in population leading to increased pollution.\n- Option B: "people use too many man-made materials" – While this is mentioned, it's part of a broader issue rather than the main reason.\n- Option C: "we have more and more industry" – This aligns closely with the article's emphasis on industrialization as a The answer is Therefore, the correct option is C: "we have more and more industry".

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what man values most according to the passage, we need to identify the primary focus and concern discussed throughout the text.\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The passage discusses pollution as a problem being accelerated faster than it can be managed. \n   - It attributes this mainly to human actions and their pursuit of a "modern way of life."\n2. **The Pursuit of Modern Life:**\n   - The passage highlights the desire for "increasing industrialization" as a chief aim of humans.\n   - It suggests that in the quest for industrial progress and a modern lifestyle, people are willing to sacrifice key aspects such as clean air, pure water, good food, health, and the future of their children.\n3. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - A. Industry: The passage states that "increasing industrialization" is a primary aim, indicating its high value to man.\n   - B. Health: Although important, the passage suggests health is often sacrificed.\n   - C. Clean air: Similarly to health, clean air is also indicated as something people are ready to sacrifice.\n   - D. The future of the children: The passage states it is often sacrificed for industrial goals.\nGiven the analysis, the question implies that the pursuit The answer is 'A. Industry.'

A: Let's think step by step.
To understand what the story about the airline pilot signifies in the context of the article, we need to analyze the analogy that the author is trying to draw. The article discusses the growing problem of pollution as a result of human industrialization and modern lifestyle, highlighting how societal progress is often pursued without considering the negative impacts on the environment.\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Context of the Article:** The article criticizes the indiscriminate pursuit of technological and industrial progress, which is leading to pollution and other environmental issues.\n2. **Analogy with the Airline Pilot:** \n   - The airline pilot mentions, "I've some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we're making rapid progress at 530 miles per hour. The bad news is that we're lost and don't know where we're going."\n   - This analogy implies that, like the plane moving rapidly but being lost, our modern society makes rapid technological and industrial progress, but lacks a clear direction or understanding of the consequences and end goals.\n3. **Implication of the Analogy:** \n   - The analogy suggests that while society is advancing rapidly, the focus is solely on progress rather than considering sustainability and the quality of life.\n   - The author's concern mirrors the airline pilot's announcement: significant The answer is 'D. the writer is worried about the future of our society'. The author, using the analogy of the airline pilot, is expressing concern that society is progressing quickly

Q: article:             Humans are naturally drawn to other life forms and the worlds outside of our own. We take delight in the existence of creatures and even whole societies beyond our everyday lives. This sense of wonder is universal. Look at the efforts that scientists have made to find out whether life of some kind exists on Mars, and the popularity of fantasy    literature or movies like The Lord of the Rings. This sense of wonder draws us to each other, to the world around us, and to the world of make-believe, but have we gone so far in creating worlds of fantasy that we are missing the pleasure of other worlds that already exist all around us? Human beings, as biologists have suggested, possess an inborn desire to connect with and understand other life forms. However, people, especially in big cities, often lead rather isolated lives. In a study of British schoolchildren, it was found that children by age eight were much more familiar with characters from television shows and video games than common wildlife. Without modem technology, a small pond could be an amazing world filled with strange and beautiful plants, insects, birds, and animals. When we lack meaningful interaction with the world around us, and sometimes even with our families and friends, we seek to understand and communicate with things that exist only in our imaginations or on a computer screen. The world of make-believe is not necessarily bad, but when the world of fantasy becomes the only outlet for our sense of wonder, then we are really missing something. We are missing a connection with the living world. Other wonderful worlds exist all around us. But even more interesting is that if we look closely enough,we can see that these worlds, in a broad sense ,are really part of our own.             question:             The popularity of The Lord of the Rings proves   _  .             options:             ['A. the close connection between man and the fantasy world', 'B. the wonderful achievements of fantasy literature', 'C. the fine taste of moviegoers around the world', 'D. the general existence of the sense of curiosity']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option, let's analyze the given article and the options provided.\n1. **Context**: The article discusses humans' natural attraction to life forms and worlds outside our immediate reality. It highlights our universal sense of wonder and curiosity that extends to fantasy worlds, as seen in efforts to find life on Mars and the popularity of works like "The Lord of the Rings."\n2. **Key Point in the Question**: The question specifically focuses on the popularity of "The Lord of the Rings."\n3. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **A. the close connection between man and the fantasy world**: While "The Lord of the Rings" is part of the fantasy world, the article emphasizes the natural attraction and curiosity humans have towards such worlds, rather than a close connection.\n   - **B. the wonderful achievements of fantasy literature**: Although "The Lord of the Rings" is indeed an achievement in fantasy literature, the article is highlighting the broader phenomenon of human curiosity and wonder, rather than literary achievements specifically.\n   - **C. the fine taste of moviegoers around the world**: The article does not discuss taste or preferences in the context of "The Lord of the Rings," but rather focuses on the sense of wonder.\n   - **D The answer is 'D. the general existence of the sense of curiosity': This option aligns with the theme of the article, which emphasizes the universal sense of wonder and curiosity that draws

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main purpose of the passage, let's analyze the content and the message it conveys:\n1. **Introduction of Theme**: The passage begins by talking about humanity's natural inclination to connect with life forms and worlds outside our own. It highlights our fascination with both real and fantastical worlds.\n2. **Examples of Wonder**: It gives examples such as efforts to find life on Mars and the popularity of fantasy literature like "The Lord of the Rings", showing how this sense of wonder is universal.\n3. **Current Situation**: The passage then describes how, especially in urban areas, people might become disconnected from the natural world. It uses the example of British schoolchildren being more familiar with fictional characters than local wildlife.\n4. **Contrast of Worlds**: There's a contrast made between the tangible world around us and the world of fantasy. While acknowledging that the fantasy world isn't inherently bad, the author suggests a potential downside if it becomes our only avenue for wonder.\n5. **Call to Awareness**: The passage concludes by suggesting that wonderful real worlds exist all around us and emphasizes the importance of recognizing that they are part of our own world, urging us to appreciate and connect with them.\nAnalyzing the options in this context:\n- **A. To show us The answer is A. To show us the hidden beauty in our world.

This option aligns well with the passage's conclusion and overall message, which highlights the importance of recognizing and

Q: article:             Chocolate is good for your heart, skin and brain. Usually, people think that chocolate is bad for their health. They describe chocolate as "something to die for" or say "death by chocolate". Now they should bite their tongues! Evidence is showing that some kinds of chocolate are actually good for you in the following ways: A happier heart Scientists at Harvard University recently examined 136 studies on cocoa-- the main ingredient in chocolate-- and found that it does seem to strengthen the heart. Studies have shown heart benefits from increased blood flow. These benefits are the result of cocoa's chemicals, which seem to prevent both cell damage and inflammation .  Better blood pressure If yours is high, chocolate may help. Jeffrey Blumberg from Tufts University recently found that people with high blood pressure who ate 3.5ounces of dark chocolate per day for two weeks saw their blood pressure drop quickly. Muscle magic Chocolate milk may help you recover after a hard workout . _  Better for your skin German researchers gave 24 women a half-cup of special cocoa every day. After three months, the women's skin was moister  and smoother. The research shows that chocolate helps protect and increase blood flow to the skin, improving its appearance. Brain gains. It sounds almost too good to be true, but research suggests that chocolate may improve your memory, attention span, reaction time, and problem-solving skills by increasing blood flow to the brain.             question:             What's the best title for this passage?             options:             ['A. Chocolate, a Healthy Food', 'B. More Chocolate, Less Health', 'C. Chocolate and Blood Pressure', 'D. Advice on Eating Chocolate']
A: Let's think step by step.
To find the best title for this passage, we'll evaluate each option in the context of the content provided in the passage. \n1. **Option A: Chocolate, a Healthy Food**  \n   - The passage highlights various health benefits of chocolate, such as heart health, improved blood pressure, muscle recovery, better skin, and enhanced brain function. It emphasizes the positive aspects of consuming chocolate, especially dark chocolate, for health benefits. This aligns well with the passage content.\n2. **Option B: More Chocolate, Less Health**  \n   - This option suggests that eating more chocolate leads to less health, which contradicts the main point of the passage. The passage argues for the health benefits of chocolate, so this option does not fit well.\n3. **Option C: Chocolate and Blood Pressure**  \n   - While the passage does discuss the impact of chocolate on blood pressure, it is only one of several health benefits mentioned. This title is too narrow and doesn't encompass the broader range of benefits discussed.\n4. **Option D: Advice on Eating Chocolate**  \n   - While the passage provides information about the benefits of chocolate, it does not specifically offer advice on how to incorporate it into one's diet, portion control, or eating habits. Thus, this title is not the most The answer is 'A. Chocolate, a Healthy Food'.

Q: article:             As a child, visiting the zoo was more a punishment than a treat. I didn't find the chimps' tea parties funny, nor the bird shows entertaining. Feeding time for seals was less painful, but their performances still seemed like they belonged more in a circus. And I hated circuses, especially the animal acts -- men teasing lions, girls balancing on elephants and monkeys playing football. I knew that every trick a circus animal did was unnatural, achieved through strict training and quite possibly cruelty. Happily, during my lifetime public attitudes and the law have changed. Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved. When my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced. As a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. "Animals belong in the wild," is a common -- and understandable -- complaint. But what do the animals themselves prefer? Generally speaking, zoo animals have a longer life. But -- you may protest -- they are not free. What? Free to be hunted and killed, free to die of hunger or thirst? Maybe sitting in a cage eating bananas isn't so bad. Not that such conditions are acceptable in modern zoos, due to the work of BIAZA, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. These days every zoo requires BIAZA's approval to operate, and the association sets the standards, observes conditions in zoos and develops animal-research programmes, both in the UK and abroad. BIAZA also organises the animal exchanges between zoos all over the world. Consequently, today, most zoo animals are born and raised in zoos, live in large, comfortable enclosures and are cared for by well-trained, knowledgeable and caring zoo employees. Of course it's no substitute for living in the wild but unfortunately this isn't always possible. Meanwhile, why not visit your local zoo and decide for yourself?             question:             The passage is mainly about   _  .             options:             ['A. how zoos have improved', 'B. whether a zoo should be closed down', 'C. a new environmental organisation', 'D. the difference between zoos and circuses']
A: Let's think step by step.
We need to determine the main focus of the passage.

Q: article:             As a child, visiting the zoo was more a punishment than a treat. I didn't find the chimps' tea parties funny, nor the bird shows entertaining. Feeding time for seals was less painful, but their performances still seemed like they belonged more in a circus. And I hated circuses, especially the animal acts -- men teasing lions, girls balancing on elephants and monkeys playing football. I knew that every trick a circus animal did was unnatural, achieved through strict training and quite possibly cruelty. Happily, during my lifetime public attitudes and the law have changed. Circuses using wild animals are now almost extinct, and zoos have definitely evolved. When my children were young, I occasionally took them to our local zoo. The elephants were in tiny cages and the gorillas looked bored as they sat peeling bananas and staring at teasing visitors. Each cage had a sign which listed the animal's name and where it came from. But, back then, there was little information included about the environmental challenges they faced. As a result, environmentalists and animal lovers often oppose zoos. "Animals belong in the wild," is a common -- and understandable -- complaint. But what do the animals themselves prefer? Generally speaking, zoo animals have a longer life. But -- you may protest -- they are not free. What? Free to be hunted and killed, free to die of hunger or thirst? Maybe sitting in a cage eating bananas isn't so bad. Not that such conditions are acceptable in modern zoos, due to the work of BIAZA, the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. These days every zoo requires BIAZA's approval to operate, and the association sets the standards, observes conditions in zoos and develops animal-research programmes, both in the UK and abroad. BIAZA also organises the animal exchanges between zoos all over the world. Consequently, today, most zoo animals are born and raised in zoos, live in large, comfortable enclosures and are cared for by well-trained, knowledgeable and caring zoo employees. Of course it's no substitute for living in the wild but unfortunately this isn't always possible. Meanwhile, why not visit your local zoo and decide for yourself?             question:             Which of the following roles are performed by BIAZA?             options:             ['A. Organising animal study projects and training zoo workers.', 'B. Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges.', 'C. Designing zoos and approving zoo operations.', 'D. Caring for ill animals and setting zoo standards.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which roles are performed by BIAZA, let's break down the information given in the article:\n1. **Setting Standards and Approving Operations:** The article mentions that every zoo requires BIAZA's approval to operate and that the association sets the standards. This aligns with BIAZA checking zoo conditions and approving operations.\n2. **Observing Conditions in Zoos:** BIAZA is involved in observing conditions in zoos, which suggests they have a role in checking if zoos meet established guidelines.\n3. **Developing Animal-Research Programmes:** The article states that BIAZA is involved in developing animal-research programmes, indicating they organize study projects related to the animals.\n4. **Organizing Animal Exchanges:** BIAZA organizes animal exchanges between zoos all over the world, which involves coordinating and managing the movement of animals to different facilities.\nGiven this breakdown, the most fitting options from those provided are:\n- **B. Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges:** This matches with BIAZA's roles of checking conditions in zoos and organizing animal exchanges.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: **B. Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges.** The answer is B. Checking zoo conditions and arranging animal exchanges.

Zoo animals should be freed into the wild.', 'B. Zoos are more popular now than in the past.', 'C. Zoo animals are more restricted than in the past.', 'D. Zoos now provide caring living conditions for animals.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement the writer would agree with, let's analyze the information and sentiments conveyed throughout the article:\n1. **Attitude Toward Historical Zoos and Circuses**:\n   - The writer expresses a negative view of zoos and circuses from their childhood, noting a lack of entertainment and concerns about animal cruelty in circuses.\n2. **Changes in Zoos Over Time**:\n   - There is a distinct acknowledgment that public attitudes and laws have evolved.\n   - Zoos have improved significantly compared to the past.\n3. **Standardization and Animal Welfare**:\n   - Modern zoos are subject to standards set by BIAZA, which ensures that animals are well taken care of.\n   - Zoos are described as having knowledgeable and caring staff, and animals live in large, comfortable enclosures.\n4. **Freedom vs. Safety**:\n   - The writer addresses the debate about animals being free in the wild versus their safety and longevity in zoos, ultimately implying that while freedom is ideal, zoos do provide a safe alternative.\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The writer suggests visiting modern zoos to witness improvements firsthand, indicating a belief that zoos are now better environments for animals than they were in the past.\nBased on these points, The answer is 'D. Zoos now provide caring living conditions for animals.'

Q: article:             In many countries, heart disease kills a lot of women and even more men. There are four major causes of this disease and these are smoking, poor or bad diet, a family history of heart disease and stressful work. Among these main wrong-doers, the most common cause is stress. What is stress and how do you feel when you are under stress? Imagine you live alone - you are lying in bed at night and, suddenly, you hear someone in the kitchen. Immediately your heart begins to beat very fast and you feel that you can hardly breathe. What you are feeling is not stress, but fear. However, your body changes in the same way when you feel stress. That means that if you feel anxious and worried during an important examination, your heart may beat very fast and you may feel breathless too. You are experiencing stress. Another common situation in which a person is likely to feel stress is to have to do something, for example, performing a boring duty, every day. Let us look at the case of Annie who was a nurse. She felt a lot of stress in her work and began to have very bad headaches at the end of the day. Each morning she woke up more tired than she was when she went to sleep. She did not want to go out in the evening with her friends and she felt unhappy all the time. Finally, she sat down and thought about her life. She saw a lot of illness and death in her work but that was not the reason why she was under stress. The real reason was that she felt unable to make a positive decision in her job - she had to do what the doctors and sisters told her. So, Annie went back to college for further study. When she graduated, she found a job where she was part of a team as before, but where she had responsibility in making decisions. Her working hours were longer and her work more difficult than when she was a nurse but she enjoyed it. She felt she was in control of her life and her work. For Annie, stress in her old job had made her change her life and end a difficult situation. Stress in her new job became a good thing because it helped her achieve satisfaction in her life and in her work.             question:             Feeling   _   is one form of stress.             options:             ['A. tired', 'B. alone', 'C. anxious', 'D. breathless']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which feeling is one form of stress, we need to analyze the text for relevant information on how stress manifests.\nThe passage describes stress as a state that causes physiological reactions similar to fear, such as a rapid heartbeat and breathlessness. It also mentions the emotional and mental state of being anxious during stressful situations, like an important examination. Furthermore, Annie's experience with stress is described as causing her to feel unhappy and tired, but these are mentioned more as effects rather than descriptors of stress itself.\nLooking at the options:\n- A. tired: While feeling tired is an effect of prolonged stress, it is not a form of stress itself.\n- B. alone: Feeling alone is not specifically mentioned as a form of stress in the passage.\n- C. anxious: The text specifically describes the sensation of being anxious as akin to experiencing stress.\n- D. breathless: The text describes breathlessness as a physical reaction, but it is practically the result of stress rather than a form of it.\nBased on the analysis, feeling anxious (option C) directly reflects a form of stress as detailed in the passage, where stress is characterized by anxiety in stressful situations.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. anxious The answer is C. anxious

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct option, let's analyze the relevant part of the passage:\nThe article states: "In many countries, heart disease kills a lot of women and even more men." This clearly indicates that heart disease causes more deaths in men than in women.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- Option A: "most men" - This option does not specify a comparison between men and women, so it's not accurate based on the passage.\n- Option B: "more men than women" - This option precisely matches the information provided in the article, stating that heart disease kills more men than women.\n- Option C: "more women than men" - This option contradicts the passage, which states the opposite.\n- Option D: "both men and women" - While true, it doesn't address the comparison given in the text, which specifies that more men die than women.\nHence, the correct answer is:\nB. more men than women The answer is B. more men than women

A: Let's think step by step.
To find the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the article and relate it to the question and available options:\n1. The question is about Annie's feelings when she was a nurse. Specifically, it asks about what she felt she had no real sense of in her work or life.\n2. The article describes Annie's experiences as a nurse. It states that Annie experienced a lot of stress and had negative symptoms like bad headaches and constant tiredness. She also didn't feel like going out with friends and felt unhappy all the time.\n3. Importantly, the article mentions that the root reason for Annie's stress was her feeling unable to make positive decisions in her job. She was required to follow orders from doctors and sisters, which implies she lacked control over her work and life.\n4. Consequently, the article states that Annie went back to college to gain more education and eventually secured a job where she had greater responsibility and decision-making power. She felt more in control of her work and life, suggesting that this change brought her satisfaction and meaning.\nNow, let's consider the options:\n- A. unhappiness: While Annie did feel unhappy, this option doesn't directly address what she lacked in terms of her work or life structure.\n- B. breakdown: This doesn't fit the The answer is 'D. responsibility', as Annie felt stressed due to her lack of decision-making opportunities in her job.

It included team work.', 'B. It demands higher qualifications.', 'C. It ensures satisfaction. Wwm', 'D. It involves decision-making.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To identify the major difference between Annie's new job and her old one, we need to consider the details provided in the article:\n1. **Old Job (Nurse):**\n   - Annie felt unhappy and stressed in her job.\n   - She did not have much control and had to follow what the doctors and sisters told her, indicating a lack of involvement in decision-making.\n   - The stress from this lack of autonomy made her life difficult.\n2. **New Job:**\n   - Annie pursued further education and gained higher qualifications.\n   - She found a new job where she was part of a team and had responsibilities in making decisions.\n   - Despite longer working hours and more demanding work, she felt more satisfied because she was in control of her work and life.\nFrom the above analysis:\n- Option A ("It included team work.") is not a major differentiator because her old job as a nurse also involved working as a part of a team.\n- Option B ("It demands higher qualifications.") is correct in terms of her pursuing further studies, but it is not highlighted as the primary difference causing a change in her stress and satisfaction levels.\n- Option C ("It ensures satisfaction.") is more of a result rather than a specific difference in job role or responsibility.\n- Option The answer is D ("It involves decision-making.") is the major difference between Annie's new job and her old one. In her new job, she had the responsibility and autonomy

Cost: PS6 per class Contact: Angela Capriati Tel: 020 8698 8439             question:             What can we learn about Caterpillar music?             options:             ['A. The event lasts about four months.', 'B. The class is different for every child.', 'C. The theme of the class changes every week.', 'D. The event teaches how to play different instruments.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To address the given question about "Caterpillar music," we need to analyze the information provided in the article specific to this event. Here's a breakdown:\n1. **Duration**: The event takes place from October 18 to December 31. This is a bit shorter than four months, so option A is inaccurate.\n2. **Class Variation**: The description mentions using puppets, actions, songs, instruments, and games. However, it doesn't specify that the class is different for each child; rather, these are standard activities for the group. Hence, option B does not fit.\n3. **Theme of the Class**: The article explicitly states, "each week we have a different theme," which directly corresponds to option C.\n4. **Teaching Instruments**: While instruments are mentioned, there is no specific detail stating that the event is teaching children how to play them. Therefore, option D is misleading.\nGiven this analysis, option C, "The theme of the class changes every week," is consistent with the information provided and is the correct choice. The answer is 'C. The theme of the class changes every week.'

Q: article:             February 4, 2012 saw the take-off of a new rising NBA star-Jeremy Lin. Among professional basketball players, Jeremy Lin's background is not typical. He graduated from Harvard University, which sends few players to the NBA, and he is the only Chinese-American NBA player. But when you watch him on the court, there is no doubt that he belongs there. He moves with speed and grace that demonstrate years of faithful practice, which is fueled by a love for basketball. Lin's enjoyment of basketball actually began in Taiwan. When Lin's father moved to U.S., his interest in the sport only grew and he passed on this love of basketball to his son, introducing him to the game at the age of five. The young Lin spent much of his youth playing basketball for fun. In high school, Lin dreamed of playing in the NBA. When he applied for college, he was not offered a single sports scholarship. However, after his admission to Harvard, he was offered a place on its college basketball team. During Lin's time at Harvard, his basketball career began to speed up. He scored 1,482 points, making him one of the highest scorers in Ivy League history. When he graduated, no professional teams offered Lin a contract, but he was invited to play in the NBA Summer League. He played well and ended up eagerly signing a contract with the Golden State Warriors. At first,playing in professional games filled Lin with excitement. He treasured opportunities to meet players he had been watching on TV for years. But slowly, the excitement _ and was replaced by anxiety. In a few very difficult months, he was cut by two teams before the New York Knicks picked him up. But he had the courage and determination to stick to his dream, so he put himself into hard training to get ready for his opportunity to come. Then his moment arrived on February 4, 2012,on which his excellent performance made him famous overnight. After that, he led the Knicks to their fifth straight victory. The Associated Press called Lin "the most surprising story in the NBA". Knicks fans developed the nickname for him "Linsanity"  . Time magazine released its 2012 list of the 100 "Most Influential People in the World", Jeremy Lin included. No doubt, Lin fever is continuing to spread if you haven't already caught "Linsanity", get ready.             question:             Which of the following elements is of little help in Lin's success?             options:             ["A. his father's influence", 'B. his devotion to basketball', 'C. his years of hard work', 'D. his graduation from Harvard University']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which element is of little help in Lin's success, let's review each option based on the article:\nA. **His father's influence**: The article mentions that Lin's father passed on his love for basketball to him, introducing him to the game at a young age. This early introduction and influence were important in developing Lin's interest and passion for basketball.\nB. **His devotion to basketball**: The article emphasizes Lin's love for the game and describes his years of faithful practice. His devotion is a key factor in his skill development and eventual success.\nC. **His years of hard work**: The article highlights Lin's dedication through years of practice and preparation, which played a significant role in achieving his dreams of playing in the NBA.\nD. **His graduation from Harvard University**: While Lin graduated from Harvard and played for their basketball team, the article indicates that he was not initially offered a professional contract after graduation. Harvard provided a platform for him to play and improve, but the degree itself did not directly help him secure a place in the NBA.\nBased on the article, "D. his graduation from Harvard University" is of little help in Lin's success compared to the other elements listed, which are directly related to his development and achievements in basketball. The answer is "D. his graduation from Harvard University"

Q: article:             Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to challenge our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they possessed. As a member of that group, you would likely inherit   that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be hesitant to really get behind yourself, fearing that your investment would not pay off. Even if you had the courage to follow your passion, your inner belief that you are not inherently talented would probably be a major drawback to investing your energy in your dream. On the other hand, if you found a way to release that negative belief, a great flood of energy would pour forth, greatly increasing the likelihood of your success. How much energy we are willing to invest in the various ideas, dreams, and visions we carry within is like the money people are, or are not, willing to invest in the various products available for trade on the stock market. And in both cases, belief plays a key role in determining how willing we are to get behind something. One way to open up the possibility for greater success in our inner economies is to understand that belief is not the reliable guide we sometimes think. There are other more reliable things of success that we can put our faith in, such as passion, feeling, and sense. Some of the most successful investors in the stock market are the ones that go against the grain (to be something that one does not like doing), trusting their sense over the common opinion held by common people about what will work. In the same way, we can learn to trust our heart's desires and our sense to guide us, questioning any beliefs that stand in the way of our ability to fully invest in ourselves. As we take out energy from limiting ideas about what is possible, we free up the resources that have the power to make our inner economy prosper.             question:             According to the passage, if a family of origin has passion for literature, the members of the family will probably_.             options:             ['A. teach literature', 'B. hate literature', 'C. write poems', 'D. enter the field of literature']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the passage and the question:\n1. **Understanding the Passage**: The passage discusses the concept of an "inner economy," which is influenced by our beliefs about what is possible. It suggests that family beliefs can impact individual beliefs—for example, if a family believes they lack musical talent, a family member might also believe they lack that talent. However, if negative beliefs are released, it can lead to a more successful "inner economy."\n2. **Identify Passage Key Points**:\n   - The family belief system influences individual beliefs.\n   - Challenging negative beliefs can unleash potential and success.\n   - Positive belief, such as having passion, leads to investing energy and increasing likelihood of success in that area.\n3. **Question Analysis**: The question asks about the outcome for family members when a family has passion for literature.\n4. **Application of Logic**:\n   - If a family has a passion for literature, it's a positive belief (not a limiting one) about literature.\n   - Similar to the musical example, where a negative belief may hinder musical pursuits, a positive belief about literature would encourage involvement in that field.\n5. **Determining the Most Likely Outcome**:\n   - Given that a positive family belief in literature The answer is 'D. enter the field of literature'. 

This option aligns with the idea that a family with a positive belief or passion for literature would likely encourage its members to

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option we cannot put our faith in as a reliable guide for success, let's analyze each option in the context provided by the article.\nThe article suggests that, unlike belief, which is not always a reliable guide, there are other elements that we can rely on for success:\n- **Passion:** The article states that passion is one of the things in which we can put our faith for success.\n- **Feeling:** It also mentions that feeling is another aspect we can rely on, much like passion.\n- **Sense:** According to the article, trusting one's sense, especially when it opposes common opinion, can be a good guide for success.\nThe article does not suggest that the stock market itself is something we can directly put our faith in for success in the inner economy of our beliefs and talents. Instead, it compares how belief systems affect our willingness to invest in ourselves to how people invest money in the stock market. The reliability discussed in this context is about personal inner success, not financial markets. Hence, the stock market is not the thing of success we should trust when it comes to inner beliefs and personal growth.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**D. stock market** The answer is 'D. stock market'

The article highlights the importance of challenging limiting beliefs to free up energy and resources, thereby increasing the likelihood of success.\n4. It emphasizes that belief is not always a reliable guide and suggests that relying on passion, feeling, and intuition can be more effective.\n5.

Let's think about how to enjoy a Zero Waste Christmas.By sending recyclable cards,we can help our friends and family reduce waste.And what better way to enjoy the spirit of Christmas than with a real tree that can be replanted in the spring? Going Zero Waste requires us to think more about what happens before and after we act.It takes ambition,and it's not always easy.But just think how good it would be,both for ourselves and for the environment, if we never had to waste anything.             question:             When is this passage probably written?             options:             ['A. After a Christmas.', 'B. Before Zero Waste starts.', 'C. Before a Christmas.', 'D. When Zero Waste is very popular.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine when this passage was probably written, let's analyze the content and context of the article:\n1. **Christmas Reference:** The passage encourages thinking about how to enjoy a "Zero Waste Christmas" and suggests starting the Zero Waste lifestyle during this time. This implies that Christmas is an upcoming event, not one that has already passed. The passage is likely aiming to inspire readers to prepare and plan for a Zero Waste Christmas.\n2. **Timing of the Initiative:** The passage indicates aspirations and provides advice, suggesting it is promoting a new or ongoing effort rather than reflecting on an already completed event.\n3. **Options Analysis:**\n   - **A. After a Christmas:** This option seems less likely because the passage talks about plans and ideas for an approaching Christmas.\n   - **B. Before Zero Waste starts:** The concept of Zero Waste is already introduced with examples such as Kamikatsu village. It implies that Zero Waste is already an established concept, albeit possibly not widely adopted yet, so it is likely about promoting this lifestyle during the holiday season.\n   - **C. Before a Christmas:** This fits well with the content and context, as the passage urges the reader to apply Zero Waste principles in the upcoming Christmas.\n   - **D. When Zero Waste is very popular:** The answer is not fitting because despite the effort to promote Zero Waste, the mention of the specific examples like the village of Kamikatsu suggests that while the idea is present,

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best answer for how to reduce waste according to the passage, let's evaluate the given options in the context of what the passage discusses:\n1. **Option A:** "To stop using plastic bottles or even PCs."\n   - The passage mentions that many plastic bottles and PCs end up in the rubbish bin. However, it does not specifically say to stop using them altogether. Instead, it suggests designing products that can be more easily repaired, reused, and recycled.\n2. **Option B:** "To create more things that can be repaired quickly."\n   - The passage suggests that products should be designed to be more easily repaired, reused, and recycled. This aligns with the idea of reducing waste by creating more sustainable products.\n3. **Option C:** "To avoid sending cards on Christmas."\n   - The passage actually suggests sending recyclable cards to help reduce waste, rather than avoiding sending cards altogether.\n4. **Option D:** "To copy the way Nature wastes nothing."\n   - This is a broad principle mentioned in the passage, encouraging us to emulate nature in terms of waste reduction.\nAfter analyzing the options, the passage explicitly encourages the principle of minimizing waste by taking inspiration from nature, which involves designing products for easy repair, reuse, and recycling. Therefore, while both The answer is **D. To copy the way Nature wastes nothing.**

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is the exception for living a Zero Waste lifestyle, let's evaluate each option in the context of reducing waste as described in the article:\n- **Option A: taking no more than we need** - The article mentions that Zero Waste living involves being careful about what we do and never taking more than needed in order to reduce waste. This aligns with the Zero Waste philosophy.\n- **Option B: reusing plastic bags** - The article specifically states that reusing plastic bags at supermarkets is a great way to reduce waste, which is consistent with the Zero Waste approach.\n- **Option C: not going food shopping when we're hungry** - The article advises against going food shopping when hungry to avoid buying too much, which helps in reducing food waste. This practice is part of the Zero Waste lifestyle.\n- **Option D: not making a plan before we shop** - The article suggests that planning before shopping helps avoid having to throw food out later, which is a strategy to reduce waste. Therefore, not making a plan would be the opposite of the advised behavior for Zero Waste living.\nThus, the correct answer is **D. not making a plan before we shop**, as it is the only option that does not support the principles of a Zero Waste lifestyle. The answer is 'D. not making a plan before we shop'.

Q: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: "R U awake?" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. " If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends.

Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. "It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, " says Rideout. With new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. " Kids should try," adds Rideout. " But parents might have to step in sometimes. "             question:             Why do children spend more time in using electronic devices?             options:             ['A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.', 'B. Because electronic devices are more exciting than before.', 'C. Because they have less other activities.', 'D. Because they have less homework to do.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why children are spending more time using electronic devices, we need to analyze the information provided in the article and connect it to the options given. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1. **Explosion in Mobile Devices**: The article highlights that the rise in the use of electronic devices is attributed to the "huge explosion in mobile devices." This suggests that the availability of more devices is a significant factor.\n2. **Increase in Cell Phone Ownership**: The study mentioned in the article indicates that nearly seven out of ten kids now have cell phones compared to four out of ten five years ago. This increase supports the idea that more kids having access to devices contributes to increased usage.\n3. **Multitasking Possibilities**: The article describes how children often multitask using multiple devices simultaneously (TV, computer, phone), suggesting that the availability of various devices makes it easy and tempting for kids to spend more time with technology.\n4. **Parental and Expert Observations**: Experts suggest children use multiple devices when they have the opportunity, reinforcing the notion that the availability of these devices plays a role in their extended use.\nGiven this analysis, the most direct reason among the options provided is:\n- **A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.**\n The answer is A. Because more electronic devices are available to them.

Q: article:             It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: "R U awake?" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. " If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?" media expert Cheryl Olson says.

Cheryl Olson is not surprised about kids' increasing use of mobile devices", 'D. most experts think teenagers should not use electronic devices for their studies']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's analyze each option against the information provided in the passage:\nOption A: "Brandon Blanco feels very annoyed about his late-night text"\n- The passage does mention a late-night text but does not provide any indication that Brandon feels annoyed. It simply states that he wakes up and reaches for his phone. Therefore, this option is not supported by the passage.\nOption B: "The teenagers using mobile devices have increased by 30% in the past five years"\n- The passage mentions that the number of kids with cell phones increased from four out of ten to nearly seven out of ten in the past five years. This implies a significant increase, but the exact percentage increase is not clarified in the passage. Therefore, this option is not directly supported by the passage.\nOption C: "Cheryl Olson is not surprised about kids' increasing use of mobile devices"\n- The passage quotes Cheryl Olson saying, "If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?" This suggests that she accepts or acknowledges the multitasking trend among kids and is not surprised by it. Therefore, this option aligns with the passage.\nOption D: "Most experts think teenagers should not use electronic devices The answer is C. Cheryl Olson is not surprised about kids' increasing use of mobile devices

Talking on the phone while staying with others.', 'C. Playing video games on the Internet.', 'D. Listening to music while relaxing.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is an example of multitasking according to the passage, we need to identify activities that involve using more than one device or engaging in multiple activities simultaneously.\n1. **Option A: Watching TV while using the computer.**\n   - This involves using two electronic devices at the same time. According to the passage, multitasking is described as doing something on your computer and also taking a phone call and having the TV on. Watching TV while using the computer fits the description of multitasking because it involves engaging with more than one device simultaneously.\n2. **Option B: Talking on the phone while staying with others.**\n   - This could involve multitasking if "staying with others" implies engaging in conversation or participating in another activity with those people while also talking on the phone. However, the passage specifically mentions multitasking in terms of using multiple electronic devices.\n3. **Option C: Playing video games on the Internet.**\n   - This activity involves using only one electronic device at a time, typically focusing on a single task, which does not match the concept of multitasking with multiple electronic devices.\n4. **Option D: Listening to music while relaxing.**\n   - While this involves two actions, "relaxing" isn't considered a task that The answer is A. Watching TV while using the computer.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option Victoria Rideout would likely agree with, we need to examine her perspective as presented in the passage.\n1. **Main Focus:** The article discusses the increasing time kids spend on electronic devices and the potential impact on their other activities.\n2. **Victoria Rideout's Role:** She is described as the lead author of a study about technology usage among kids. \n3. **Rideout's Concern:** She expresses the importance of being able to stop multitasking and concentrate deeply on one thing, especially when it comes to homework.\n4. **Contextual Clue:** Rideout emphasizes that maintaining a balance is crucial and highlights the role of parents in ensuring appropriate usage of technology.\nNow let's assess the options:\n- **Option A:** "Kids should do homework while surfing the Internet." \n  - This contradicts Rideout's concern about concentrating deeply on one thing, implying multitasking is not ideal.\n  \n- **Option B:** "Kids should do homework in a place without disturbance."\n  - Aligns well with Rideout's views, suggesting a focus on one task (homework), which implies a conducive environment for concentration.\n- **Option C:** "Kids should spend more time on homework."\n  - This is not directly addressed by Rideout, as The answer is not about increasing homework time but focusing better during the existing homework time.

- **Option D:** "Kids should have more homework than before."

Q: article:             American researchers say drinking tea may help strengthen the body's defense system against infection. Doctors at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, did the study. The team studied a chemical found in black, green, oolong and pekoe tea. This chemical is an amino acid called L-theanine. The scientists say it may increase the strength of gamma delta T cells. That's the letter T, not the drink. Gamma delta T cells are part of the body's defense. First, the researchers mixed some of these cells with antigens found in the amino acid . Antigens help the body react to infection. Then the scientists added some bacteria. Within twenty-four hours, the cells produced a lot of interferon, a substance that fights infection. Cells not mixed with the antigens did not produce interferon. In the second part of the study, eleven people drank five to six cups of black tea every day. Ten other people drank the same amount of instant coffee. That is dried coffee mixed with hot water. Two weeks later, and again two weeks after that, the researchers tested the blood of all twenty-one people. They also looked at what happened when they added bacteria to the blood cells. They found that the tea drinkers produced five times more interferon after they started drinking tea. The coffee drinkers did not produce interferon. Doctor Jack Bukowski led the study. He says the antigens added to the gamma delta T cells were responsible for the increased reaction to the bacteria. He says that the study also showed that the cells were able to remember the bacteria and fight them again the next time. Earlier research already has found that tea can help prevent heart disease and cancer. Doctor Bukowski says the new study must be repeated by more people. "If the findings prove to be true," he says, "then tea drinking might also help protect against bacterial infections." He says the amino acid L-theanine could be removed from the tea and used as a drug to strengthen the body's defenses.             question:             We may know from the text that   _   can be found in different kinds of tea.             options:             ['A.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what can be found in different kinds of tea based on the article, let's evaluate the options by referring to the relevant information in the text.\nThe article states: "The team studied a chemical found in black, green, oolong, and pekoe tea. This chemical is an amino acid called L-theanine." \nThe options are:\n- A. L-theanine\n- B. Gamma delta T cells\n- C. interferon\n- D. bacteria\nFrom this, we can conclude that the chemical known as L-theanine is found in different kinds of tea. Gamma delta T cells, interferon, and bacteria are not ingredients in tea; they are part of the body's response or used in the study.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. L-theanine The answer is A.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why tea may help strengthen the body's defense system, we need to focus on the findings from the study described in the article. \n1. The study involved a chemical found in various types of tea, an amino acid called L-theanine.\n2. Researchers found that when L-theanine was mixed with gamma delta T cells, and bacteria were added, these cells produced a significant amount of interferon.\n3. Interferon is a substance known to fight infection.\n4. When people drank black tea regularly, their blood cells produced five times more interferon than when they started drinking tea, compared to those who drank coffee.\nThis indicates that drinking tea enabled the body to produce more interferon, strengthening the body's defense against infection.\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n- Option A: "to add some bacteria to the blood cells" - This is incorrect. The bacteria were used in the study to test and trigger the body's response, not a direct action of drinking tea.\n  \n- Option B: "the body to produce more gamma delta T cells" - This is not directly mentioned as a result of drinking tea. The study highlighted the role of pre-existing gamma delta T cells, not an increase in their quantity.\n  \n- Option C: "the body to produce The answer is 'C. the body to produce more interferon'

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, we need to analyze Dr. Bukowski's statements in the article regarding the study's findings and any suggested actions or recommendations.\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The study explored the effects of tea, specifically the chemical L-theanine, on the body's defense system against infections by boosting gamma delta T cells.\n2. **Dr. Bukowski's Statements in the Article**:\n   - Dr. Bukowski mentions that the study must be repeated by more researchers: "Doctor Bukowski says the new study must be repeated by more people."\n   - He suggests that if further studies confirm the findings, tea drinking could potentially protect against bacterial infections: "If the findings prove to be true,' he says, 'then tea drinking might also help protect against bacterial infections.'"\n   - There is no mention of Dr. Bukowski removing L-theanine and creating a drug, only that it could be a possibility in the future: "He says the amino acid L-theanine could be removed from the tea and used as a drug to strengthen the body's defenses."\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: States that the findings have already been proven true.

Tea Is Better than Coffee', 'B. Our Body Needs Tea', 'C. Tea Can Help Prevent Cancer', 'D. Tea May Help Fight Infection']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the text, we need to identify the main point or focus of the article.\n1. The first paragraph mentions a study by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which suggests that drinking tea may help strengthen the body's defense system against infection due to a chemical in tea called L-theanine.\n2. The article details how L-theanine increases the production of gamma delta T cells, which are part of the body's defense system.\n3. It mentions an experiment in which people who drank tea produced more interferon, a substance that fights infection, compared to coffee drinkers who did not produce interferon.\n4. The article concludes by suggesting that if the findings are true, tea might help protect against bacterial infections and that L-theanine could potentially be used as a drug to strengthen the body's defenses.\n5. It also briefly mentions that earlier research found tea can help prevent heart disease and cancer, but this study is specifically about fighting infections.\nNow, considering the options:\n- Option A "Tea Is Better than Coffee": The article didn't focus on comparing tea and coffee overall, only in terms of producing interferon. This title doesn't capture the main focus.\n  \n- Option B "Our Body Needs Tea": This is a broad statement that doesn't The answer is 'D. Tea May Help Fight Infection'. This option accurately captures the central focus of the article, which is about the potential of tea to help strengthen the body's defense

Q: article:             A subject which seems to have been insufficiently studied by doctors and psychologists is the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of mankind. There seems no doubt that the general character of the landscape, the relative length of day and night, and the climate must all play a big part in determining what kind of people we are. It is true that a few studies have been made. Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply, or perhaps types of land that provide breeding places for pests like mosquitoes or rats. Moreover, we can all generalize about types of people we have met. Those living in countries with long dark winters are apt to be less talkative and less vivacious than inhabitants of countries where the climate is more equable. And where the olive and the orange grow, there the inhabitants are cheerful, talkative, and spontaneous. But these commonplace generalizations are inadequate: the influence of climate and geography should be studied in depth. Do all mountain dwellers live to a ripe old age? Does the drinking of wine, rather than beer, result in a sunny and open temperament? Is the strength and height of one of the Kenyan tribes due to their habitual drinking of the blood of cows? We are not yet sure of the answers to such questions, but let us hope that something of benefit to mankind may eventually result from such studies.             question:             _   might serve as a suitable title for this selection.             options:             ['A. The Importance of Geographical Environment', 'B. The Influence of Geographical Environment on Man', 'C. Generalization of Types of People', 'D. Geographical Environment, a Mysterious Subject']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most suitable title for the article, we must first analyze the main ideas and arguments presented.\n1. **Main Idea:** The article discusses the potential influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of humans. It points out that while some studies have been done, there's a lack of in-depth research on this topic.\n2. **Examples Provided:** The article gives examples such as the health of certain populations linked to geographic factors (presence/absence of specific substances in water, or breeding areas for pests), and generalizations about temperaments based on the climate (e.g., people from regions with long dark winters vs. those where olives and oranges grow).\n3. **Argument for Further Research:** The article argues for more comprehensive studies to better understand the role of geography and climate in determining human health and temperament, suggesting potentially significant insights could be gained.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- **Option A: The Importance of Geographical Environment**\n  - This option suggests the focus is on emphasizing the significance of geography in general, but may not capture the nuanced discussion about its specific influence on human health and temperament.\n- **Option B: The Influence of Geographical Environment on Man**\n  - This option directly reflects the article's emphasis on the impact of geography The answer is B. The Influence of Geographical Environment on Man

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct inference regarding "iodine, fluoride, and calcium" using context clues from the article, let's break it down:\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The article discusses the influence of geography and climate on health. It mentions that scientists have identified factors affecting health, such as certain substances in the water supply, and their influence can be either beneficial or harmful.\n2. **Reference to Substances**: The article specifically states, "Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply."\n3. **Analyzing the List**: The substances iodine, fluoride, calcium, and iron are mentioned in the context of contributing to health conditions, but it doesn't specify exactly how, only implying their presence or absence has an impact.\n4. **Inferences from Available Information**:\n   - Option B ('harmful substances in the water supply') is not supported since the text does not label these substances as harmful.\n   - Option C ('substances which help provide breeding places for pests') is not mentioned or implied in the context given.\n   - Option D ('substances contributory to good health') The answer is likely incorrect as the text doesn't explicitly state that these substances are only contributory to good health.

Q: article:             A subject which seems to have been insufficiently studied by doctors and psychologists is the influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of mankind. There seems no doubt that the general character of the landscape, the relative length of day and night, and the climate must all play a big part in determining what kind of people we are. It is true that a few studies have been made. Where all the inhabitants of a particular area enjoy exceptionally good or bad health, scientists have identified contributory factors such as the presence or absence of substances like iodine, fluoride, calcium, or iron in the water supply, or perhaps types of land that provide breeding places for pests like mosquitoes or rats. Moreover, we can all generalize about types of people we have met. Those living in countries with long dark winters are apt to be less talkative and less vivacious than inhabitants of countries where the climate is more equable.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best answer, let's analyze the given article and question. The author argues that the influence of geography and climate on psychological and physical health has not been sufficiently studied and suggests that much more in-depth research is needed in this area. The author provides examples of limited generalizations and suggests that more thorough investigations could be beneficial.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- 'A. focus on some unknown aspects': This option implies that the research should target specific, unexplored areas, but it doesn’t convey the need for overall depth as emphasized by the author.\n- 'B. be pursued on a larger scale': This option suggests expanding the research in terms of size or population but does not necessarily imply deeper exploration into specific causal relationships, which is the author's main point.\n- 'C. be carried out within a larger scope': Similar to option B, this implies a broader range but not necessarily more depth.\n- 'D. go much deeper': This option aligns well with the author’s call for in-depth study beyond the current generalizations and limited understanding.\nConsidering the context of the article and the author's focus on needing more comprehensive and detailed studies, the best choice is:\n'D. go much deeper' The answer is 'D. go much deeper'

A: Let's think step by step.
The author discusses the potential influence of geography and climate on the psychological and physical health of people. The text mentions that a few studies have been done to identify factors affecting health in certain regions but emphasizes that this is an under-researched area. The author notes that, while we can make generalizations based on climate and geography, these are insufficient and suggests deeper studies are needed. The hope expressed is that such studies will be beneficial to mankind.\nNow, let's consider the provided options:\n- **A. generalize better about types of people**: Although the text critiques the existing generalizations as inadequate, the primary aim is not simply to make better generalizations but to understand the underlying influence on health and temperament.\n- **B. find better water supplies**: This option doesn’t align with the author's focus. While water quality is a factor already studied, the article does not suggest that finding better water supplies is the main goal of studying geographic influence.\n- **C. gain an insight into its influence on mankind**: This option closely aligns with the main theme of the passage. The author emphasizes the need to study the influence of geography and climate in depth to understand how they affect both psychological and physical health.\n- **D. live to a ripe old age**: Though the The answer is C. gain an insight into its influence on mankind

Q: article:             "Children who eat less salt and drink fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks may significantly lower their risks of obesity," researchers recently reported in the journal Hypertension. "Sugar-sweetened soft drinks are a significant source of calorie intake in children," said Feng J. He, a researcher at St George's University of London, England. "It has been shown that sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption is related to obesity in young people." They wanted to know whether there is a link between salt intake and sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption. Dr He and colleagues analyzed data from a 1997 national survey of more than 2,000 people between 4 and 18 in Britain. "We found that children eating a lower-salt diet drank less fluid," said He. "From our research, we estimated that 1 gram of salt cut from their daily diet would reduce fluid intake by 100 grams per day." The researchers also found that children eating a lower-salt diet drank fewer sugar-sweetened soft drinks. From their research, they predicted that reducing salt intake by 1 gram each day would reduce sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption by 27 grams per day, after. "If children aged 4 to 18 cut their salt intake by half, there would be a decrease of about two sugar-sweetened soft drinks per week per child, so each child would decrease calorie intake by almost 250 kilocalories per week," Dr He said. In previous studies, researchers found that a low-salt diet lowers blood pressure in children, and prevents the development of high blood pressure later in life. "Both high blood pressure and obesity increase the risk of having strokes and heart attacks," Dr He said. Dr He recommends that parents check labels and choose low-salt food products. "Small reductions in the salt content of 10 to 20 percent cannot be detected by the human salt taste receptors   and do not cause any technological or safety problems," Dr He said.             question:             According to the passage, obesity is directly linked to   _  .             options:             ['A. high-salt foods', 'B. sugar-sweetened soft drinks', 'C. high blood pressure', 'D. strokes and heart attacks']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the passage:\n1. The passage discusses a study reported in the journal Hypertension, focusing on the risks of obesity in children related to their dietary choices, specifically mentioning salt intake and sugar-sweetened soft drinks.\n2. It states that "sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption is related to obesity in young people," highlighting the link between the intake of these drinks and obesity.\n3. The passage explains that reducing salt intake can lead to lower consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks, which are a significant calorie source for children, potentially reducing the risk of obesity.\n4. Additionally, while high blood pressure is mentioned as a factor that, along with obesity, increases the risk of strokes and heart attacks, it is not presented as directly linked to obesity.\n   \nTherefore, the passage directly links obesity to the consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks. So, the correct answer is:\nB. sugar-sweetened soft drinks The answer is B. sugar-sweetened soft drinks

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement Dr. He would agree to, let's break down each option in light of the study's findings and Dr. He's comments:\n- **Option A: "The less salt people eat, the healthier people become."**  \n  The article mentions that reducing salt intake can reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and help lower blood pressure in children, which in turn may prevent high blood pressure and obesity. However, this statement is very broad and absolute, and while reducing salt can offer certain health benefits, it's not conclusive that less salt always equates to better health in every individual case. Therefore, Dr. He might not agree with this sweeping statement without context.\n- **Option B: "Children should reduce fluid intake in their daily life."**  \n  Dr. He's findings suggest that children who consume less salt tend to drink less fluid naturally. However, encouraging children to reduce their fluid intake isn't explicitly mentioned as a recommendation. Instead, the focus is on reducing salt to naturally bring down unhealthy fluid, i.e., sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption.\n- **Option C: "No high-salt food products will be available in shops."**  \n  Dr. He suggests reducing salt in food products but doesn't suggest that all high-salt The answer is D. A low-salt diet may prevent both high blood pressure and obesity.

Children.', 'B. Parents.', 'C. Doctors.', 'D. Researchers.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine who should take effective action after reading the passage, we need to consider the information provided and the roles of the individuals mentioned. The passage discusses reducing salt intake and its potential benefits in decreasing sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption, reducing obesity risk, and lowering blood pressure in children. Here are the options and their considerations:\n- **A. Children.** While children are the ones whose salt and soft drink consumption habits are being discussed, they may not necessarily have the knowledge or authority to take effective action on their own, especially younger children.\n- **B. Parents.** Parents are the primary caregivers and decision-makers when it comes to their children's diet. The passage suggests that parents can take action by checking labels and choosing low-salt food products. Thus, parents are in a position to implement the dietary changes recommended in the article.\n- **C. Doctors.** While doctors can provide guidance and recommendations regarding dietary changes, the passage does not emphasize their role in directly taking action regarding children's salt and soft drink consumption beyond providing advice.\n- **D. Researchers.** Researchers conducted the study and provided the findings, but they are not responsible for implementing dietary changes in children's lives.\nConsidering these points, the most logical answer is **B.

Q: article:             Like every language, American English is full of special expressions, phrases that come from the day-to-day life of the people and develop in their own way. Our expression today is "to face the music". When someone says, "Well, I guess I'll have to face the music," it does not mean he's planning to go to the concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you didn't do this or that. Awful music indeed, but it has to be faced. At sometime or another, every one of us has to face the music, especially as children. We can all remember father's angry voice, "I want to talk to you." and only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was! The phrase "to face the music" is familiar to every American, young and old. It is at least 100 years old. And where did this expression come from? The first explanation comes from the American novelist, James Fenimore Looper. He said, in 1851, that the expression was first used by actors while waiting to go on the stage. When they got their cue  to go on, they often said, "Well, it's time to face the music." And that was exactly what they did--facing the orchestra  which was just below them. And an actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of an audience that might be friendly or perhaps _ , especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. If he did not, there would be no play. So the expression "to face the music" came to mean "having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice." Other explanations about the expression go back to the army. When the men faced an inspection  by their leader, the soldiers would be worried about how well they looked. Was their equipment clean, shiny enough to pass the inspection? Still the men had to go out and face the music of the band as well as the inspection. What else could they do? Another army explanation is more closely linked to the idea of facing the results and accepting the responsibility for something that should not have been done. For example, when a man is forced out of the army because he did something terrible, he is dishonored. The band does not play. Only the drums tap a sad, slow beat. The soldier is forced to leave, facing such music as it is and facing the back of his horse.             question:             How many ways does the phrase "to face the music" comes from?             options:             ['A. 1.', 'B. 2.', 'C. 3.', 'D. 4.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The article provides several different explanations for the origin of the phrase "to face the music":\n1. Theatrical Origin: As explained by James Fenimore Cooper, actors used the expression when they were about to go on stage, facing the orchestra in the process. This evokes the idea of facing a potentially daunting situation.\n2. Army Inspection: Soldiers facing an inspection by their leader, with the music of the band playing, could be another origin. Here, the emphasis is on confronting a situation where their appearance and equipment are scrutinized.\n3. Military Dishonor: Another army-related explanation involves a soldier being dishonorably discharged, which is marked by the sad, slow beat of drums. This ties the phrase to facing the consequences and accepting responsibility for one's actions.\nThus, the article outlines three different explanations for the phrase "to face the music."\nSo, the correct answer is "C. 3." The answer is 'C. 3.'

To face something far less pleasant.', 'B. To face the stage.', "C. To face the back of one's horse.", "D. To face one's leader."]
A: Let's think step by step.
To understand the meaning of "to face the music," let's analyze the context of the expression provided in the article.\n1. The expression "to face the music" is associated with dealing with unpleasant situations or consequences. It does not literally involve anything related to music or concerts.\n2. The article gives examples:\n   - Being called in by a boss to explain mistakes.\n   - As children, having to talk to a father after disobeying.\n   - Actors preparing to face the audience and orchestra, conveying a sense of nervousness or fear.\n   - Soldiers during inspections, worrying if they will pass, and having to confront inspections even if it was unpleasant.\n3. The expression is linked with the necessity of undergoing an experience that is unavoidable and potentially unpleasant, similar to the way army soldiers or actors are described to experience it.\n4. Thus, the expression means coming to terms with and dealing with difficult or unpleasant responsibilities or consequences.\nGiven these analyses, the option that best describes the meaning of "to face the music" is "A. To face something far less pleasant." The answer is A. To face something far less pleasant.

Q: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we should analyze the passage to understand the author's perspective and background. \n1. The passage discusses two challenges in life: acquiring wealth honestly and using it properly.\n2. The author reflects on an observation in a golf club where older, once-successful men are now spending their time "talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them." This implies that despite their past successes in business, they seem to lack fulfillment now.\n3. The author suggests that happiness isn't necessarily tied to material prosperity but to productivity and sustaining a purpose or challenge in life.\n4. He mentions finding inspiration in biblical teachings and the words of St. Paul, which focus on active engagement and perseverance in life.\n5. The author wants to feel, at the end of his life, that he has fought a good fight and kept the faith.\nGiven this analysis, the author emphasizes the importance of an active, purposeful life and considers it vital for happiness. Therefore, the statement that best reflects the author's view from the passage is:\n'B. held a positive attitude towards an active life'. The answer is B. held a positive attitude towards an active life.

Q: article:             Two of the hardest things to accomplish in this world are to acquire wealth by honest effort and, having gained it, to learn how to use it properly. Recently 1 walked into the locker room of a rather well-known golf club after finishing a round.It was in the late afternoon and most of the members had left for their homes. But a half-dozen or so men past middle age were still seated at tables talking aimlessly and drinking more than was good for them. These same men can be found there day after day.and,strangely enough,each one of these men had been a man of affairs and wealth,successful in business and respected in the community.If material prosperity were the chief necessity for happiness, then each one should have been happy. Yet,it seemed to me,something very important was missing,else there would not have been the constant effort to escape the realities of life through scotch and soda.

To use wealth properly,eat,drink and be merry.', 'B. Where there is a will,there is a wav.', 'C. As life is but like a dream,a man is like a fruit tree.', 'D. If you cease to struggle,you cease to live.']
A: Let's think step by step.
The passage presented by the writer primarily discusses the relationship between wealth, happiness, and the essence of a meaningful life. It opens with the notion that gaining wealth through honest efforts and learning to use it properly are significant challenges in life. The writer then shares an observation of wealthy men who, despite their material prosperity, seem to be escaping the realities of life through excessive drinking and aimlessness, suggesting they are not truly happy.\nThe critical point here is the writer's belief that prosperity alone does not guarantee happiness—it's the continuous effort and struggle in life that lends purpose and meaning to one's existence. The writer emphasizes the idea that when people stop being productive and cease to struggle, they begin to wither away, akin to a fruitless tree.\nIn the latter part of the passage, the biblical reference from Genesis and St. Paul's words underscore the writer's personal philosophy: life should be a continuous struggle to maintain productivity, purpose, and faith.\nThus, the essence of the writer's message in the passage is the necessity of a persistent struggle and effort to live a meaningful life. When we consider the options:\n- A. Suggests indulgence, which contradicts the writer's stance.\n- B. Implies determination, but lacks the emphasis on continuous struggle.\n- C. Discuss The answer is D. If you cease to struggle, you cease to live. 

This option aligns most closely with the message in the passage, which stresses the importance of continuous

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the source from which the passage is likely taken, let's analyze its content and context:\n1. **Subject Matter**: The passage discusses themes of wealth, personal fulfillment, productivity, and philosophical reflections on life. It contains personal reflections and insights about life, drawing from personal experiences and religious texts.\n2. **Tone and Style**: The writing is reflective and introspective, with references to biblical passages and personal philosophies about life and success.\n3. **Purpose**: The purpose seems to be to convey personal insights and lessons learned, possibly sharing experiences or moral teachings from the author's life.\nNow let's evaluate the purpose of each option:\n- **A. an autobiography**: An autobiography is a self-written account of the author's life, often including personal reflections, experiences, and the author's philosophy on life—much like the passage reflects on wealth, happiness, and personal fulfillment.\n- **B. a photography book**: Typically contains visual content with minimal text. While it may have captions or descriptions, it's unlikely to have reflective or philosophical prose like the passage.\n- **C. a science fiction**: This genre focuses on speculative, futuristic, or imaginative content that doesn't align with the reflective, philosophical, and real-world themes discussed in the passage.\n- **D. The answer is A. an autobiography

Q: article:             You've probably heard of Marco Polo, but how much do you actually know about him and his incredible journey? Marco was the original travel writer, whose trade contacts with Asia changed Europe, opening it up to new ideas and cultures. Marco Polo was born in the Venetian Republic around 1254.At the time, Venice was one of the most powerful trading cities in the world, and was ruled as an independent city state.Marco's mother died when he was young, so he was brought up by his aunt and uncle.When Marco was born, his brother (Maffeo) and father (Niccolo), who were successful merchants, were away on a trading voyage.They didn't get back until Marco was about 15. In 1271, Niccolo and Maffeo set off again for Asia, this time taking Marco with them.On a previous journey they'd met Kublai Khan (the Yuan Dynasty), and they were keen to establish trade links between Kublai's empire and Venice.The Polos sailed across the Mediterranean to Acre (now in northern Israel).Then, they traveled by camel to the port of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.Their plan was to sail to China but they couldn't find any good boats.So, they continued the journey overland, finally meeting Kublai Khan at his summer palace in Xanadu, about 275 kms north of modern Beijing.Marco was now probably 21 years ol The journey had taken over three years. The Polos had learnt a great deal about the world during their travels and so Kublai employed Marco as a government official.This gave Marco the opportunity to travel around much of Kublai's empire in China.In fact, Kublai found the Polos so useful that he was unwilling to let them return home.However, in 1292, the Polos eventually left, sailing from China and ending up in Hormuz again.The journey was extremely dangerous: of the 600 travelers who set off, only 18 arrived in Hormuz, including all three of the Polo family. The Polos finally returned to Venice in 1295, twenty-four years after setting off.They had traveled 24,000 kms.By this time Venice was at war with Genoa, its trade rival.Unfortunately for Marco, he was captured by the Genoese and imprisione However, he used his time as a prisoner to write a book about his family's travels: II Milione (known as The Travels of Marco Polo in English).It was the first book to tell Europeans about China and the East.No original copy survives, but there are several versions of it.Marco's writings influenced many other travelers, most notably Christopher Columbus, who carried a copy of II Milione with him on his voyage in search of Asia. After his release from prison in 1299, Marco rejoined his father and uncle in Venice.The family were now even wealthier than before thanks to the many treasures they'd brought back from the East.Marco financed many more trading journeys but never left the city again.He died in 1324 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice.             question:             Which of the following is true according to the passage?             options:             ["A. Soon after his mother's death, Marco was raised by his father.", 'B. Marco spent about six years on the way to China and back to Venice.', 'C. Marco died at the age of 70 in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice.', 'D. Marco was born into a very poor family but died in wealth.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which option is true according to the passage, let's examine each option in light of the information provided in the text:\n**Option A:** "Soon after his mother's death, Marco was raised by his father."\n- The passage states that Marco's mother died when he was young, and he was brought up by his aunt and uncle, not his father. So, this statement is false.\n**Option B:** "Marco spent about six years on the way to China and back to Venice."\n- The passage mentions that the journey to meet Kublai Khan took over three years. They left in 1271 and didn't return until 1295, totaling approximately 24 years for their entire journey and stay in China. Thus, this option is incorrect as well.\n**Option C:** "Marco died at the age of 70 in the church of San Lorenzo in Venice."\n- Marco was born around 1254 and died in 1324, making him around 70 years old when he died. However, the passage states he was buried in the church of San Lorenzo, not that he died there. Still, this option contains the correct age at death but specifies the location inaccurately.\n**Option D:** "Marco was born into a very poor family but died in The answer is wealth."

- The passage indicates that Marco was born into a family of successful merchants, suggesting they were not very poor. They became even wealthier after Marco's

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the source of the passage, we need to consider its content and style. Here's a breakdown:\n1. **Content Analysis**: The passage provides historical details about Marco Polo’s life, including his travels, interactions with Kublai Khan, and the impact of his book. It chronicles his journey's timeline, his achievements, and the socio-political context of Venice during his time.\n2. **Contextual Clues**: \n   - The emphasis is on historical events, such as interactions between Venice and Asia.\n   - It mentions the historical impact of Marco Polo’s book, "II Milione," on later explorers, including Columbus.\n   - There is a focus on Polo’s birth, travels, and eventual death, which are all aspects of historical significance.\n3. **Style and Purpose**: \n   - The passage is informative and educational, aiming to recount historical events and figures.\n   - The writing style is consistent with how historical narratives are typically conveyed, focusing on a chronological account of a person’s life and their impact on history.\nGiven these observations, the passage is most consistent with something you would find in a history book (Option C).

Q: article:             Finding time to read is an important part of developing reading and writing skills for all kids. And there are many easy and convenient ways to make reading a part of each day -- even when it's tough to find time to sit down with a book. Car trips, waits in checkout lines and the doctor's office are all opportunities for reading. Keep books or magazines in your car, or backpack to pull out whenever you're going to be in one place for a while. Even if you can't finish a book, read a few pages or discuss some of the pictures. Encourage kids to bring favorite books and magazines along wherever you go. While it's attractive to provide electronic games and readers, be sure to alternate electronic media with plenty of opportunities to read traditional print books. Reading opportunities are everywhere you go. While riding in the car, for example, encourage kids to spot words and letters (on billboards, store signs, etc.), turning it into a game ("Who'll be the first to find a letter B?"). Even daily tasks like cooking can provide reading moments. Kids can assist you as you cook by telling you how much flour to measure. Give your child a catalogue to read while you sort through the mail. Ask relatives to send your child letters, e-mail, or text messages, and read them together. Help your child create letters or messages to send back to the relatives. These types of activities help kids see the purpose of reading and of print. Even when you're trying to get things done, you can encourage reading. While cleaning, for instance, you might ask your child to read a favorite book to you while you work. Make sure kids get some time to spend quietly with books, even if it means cutting back on other activities, like watching TV or playing video games. Most important, be a reader yourself. Kids who see their parents reading are likely to imitate them and become readers, too!             question:             How does the author advise kids to keep in touch with relatives?             options:             ['A.

Q: article:             After giving a talk at a high school, I was asked to pay a visit to a special student. An illness had kept the boy home, but he had expressed an interest in meeting me. I was told it would mean a great deal to him, so I agreed. During the nine-mile drive to his home, I found out something about Matthew. He had muscular dystrophy  . When he was born, the doctor told his parents that he would not live to five, and then they were told he would not make it to ten. Now he was thirteen. He wanted to meet me because I was a gold-medal power lifter, and I knew about overcoming obstacles and going for my dreams. I spent over an hour talking to Matthew. Never once did he complain or ask, "Why me?" He spoke about winning and succeeding and going for his dreams. Obviously, he knew what he was talking about. He didn't mention that his classmates had made fun of him because he was different. He just talked about his hopes for the future, and how one day he wanted to lift weights with me. When we had finished talking, I went to my briefcase and pulled out the first gold medal I had won and put it around his neck. I told him he was more of a winner and knew more about success and overcoming obstacles than I ever would. He looked at it for a moment, then took it off and handed it back to me. He said, "You are a champion. You earned that medal. Someday when I get to the Olympics and win my own medal, I will show it to you." Last summer I received a letter from Matthew's parents telling me that Matthew had passed away. They wanted me to have a letter he had written to me a few days before:             question:             The boy looked forward to meeting the author because    _   .             options:             ["A. he was one of the author's fans", 'B. he wanted to get to the Olympics and win a medal', 'C. he was also good at weight lifting', 'D. he admired the author for his courage very much']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the boy, Matthew, looked forward to meeting the author, let's consider the details presented in the article:\n1. Matthew was a special student who had expressed an interest in meeting the author. He was at home due to an illness, muscular dystrophy, but he still wanted to meet the author despite his condition.\n2. The author is described as a gold-medal power lifter, someone who knows about overcoming obstacles and going for dreams. This suggests that Matthew was interested in him because of these qualities.\n3. Matthew had lived beyond the life expectancy initially given by doctors, showing his perseverance and desire to overcome obstacles. \n4. During their meeting, Matthew talked about his hopes for the future, his dreams, and his desire to lift weights and perhaps even get to the Olympics one day.\nOut of the provided options, let's assess them:\n- Option A: "he was one of the author's fans" - While possible, this statement is too general and does not specifically address Matthew's admiration of the author's courage in overcoming difficulties.\n- Option B: "he wanted to get to the Olympics and win a medal" - This is mentioned as one of Matthew's dreams, but it doesn't directly address why he wanted to meet the author specifically.\n- Option C The answer is 'D. he admired the author for his courage very much.'

Matthew was an athlete', 'B. Matthew was an optimistic and determined boy', 'C. The author used to have the same disease as Matthew had', 'D. Matthew became a champion before he died']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, I'll analyze the information provided in the passage and compare it with each of the given options.\n1. **Option A: Matthew was an athlete**\n   - The passage indicates that Matthew had a strong interest in sports and wanted to lift weights, but there is no evidence that he was an athlete. His muscular dystrophy limited his physical activities, so this option is likely incorrect.\n2. **Option B: Matthew was an optimistic and determined boy**\n   - The passage emphasizes Matthew's optimism and determination. Despite his illness, he spoke about winning, succeeding, and going for his dreams. He never complained or asked "Why me?" and he expressed a desire to achieve great things in the future. This option aligns well with the details provided.\n3. **Option C: The author used to have the same disease as Matthew had**\n   - The passage does not mention that the author had muscular dystrophy. The author's connection to Matthew was through being a gold-medal power lifter and knowing about overcoming obstacles, not through having the same disease. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n4. **Option D: Matthew became a champion before he died**\n   - There is no indication in the passage that Matthew became a champion or won any competitions before he The answer is B. Matthew was an optimistic and determined boy.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why Matthew didn't accept the author's medal, we need to consider the context of the story and Matthew's character. \n1. **Context of the Situation:** The author visited Matthew, who had muscular dystrophy, and was inspired by Matthew's positive outlook and determination in the face of adversity.\n2. **Character of Matthew:** Despite his challenges, Matthew spoke about his dreams and aspirations, never complaining or expressing self-pity. He demonstrated confidence in his future goals, specifically mentioning his desire to win his own medal.\n3. **Matthew's Response to the Medal:** When the author offered his first gold medal to Matthew, it was returned with the statement: "You are a champion. You earned that medal. Someday when I get to the Olympics and win my own medal, I will show it to you."\nGiven these points, Matthew didn't accept the medal not because of the material value or his life expectancy, but because he had confidence in his own ability to achieve the same success. He was determined to win his own medal, demonstrating his belief in his potential to reach his dreams.\nTherefore, the most fitting answer is:\n- **B. he was sure that he could win one in the future**. The answer is B. he was sure that he could win one in the future.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the best title for the passage, we should consider the main theme and focus of the story.\n1. The passage is about a visit to a special student named Matthew who has muscular dystrophy.\n2. The narrator, a gold-medal power lifter, was invited to meet Matthew because of his achievements and ability to overcome obstacles, which inspired Matthew.\n3. During their meeting, Matthew expresses his dreams and aspirations, despite his illness.\n4. Matthew's attitude and determination to pursue his dreams make him stand out as someone who embodies the spirit of a champion, even more than the narrator suggests he feels about himself.\n5. The story concludes with Matthew returning the gold medal, indicating that he wants to earn his own in the future.\n6. After Matthew's passing, the narrator receives a letter from Matthew's parents, signifying the lasting impact of the encounter.\nConsidering these points, the central theme of the story is not just about Matthew being a special friend or the fact that he is sick. Rather, it emphasizes Matthew's champion spirit and his outlook on life, which goes beyond mere physical accomplishments.\nTherefore, the best title that encapsulates the essence of this passage is "C. A real champion." This title highlights Matthew's inner strength and determination, which The answer is "C. A real champion."

Q: article:             Naps--short sleeps during the day--may improve memory, experts said recently.  New research conducted by brain researcher Avi Karni of the University of Haifa in Israel explores the possibility that naps help lock in sometimes long-term memories. "We still don't know exactly how memory system works during sleep, but the results of this research suggest it is possible to speed up memory consolidation ," Karni said. Long-term memory refers  to memories that stay with us for years, such as "what" memories -- a car accident that happened yesterday-- or "how to" memories, such as one's learned ability to play the pianos. Karni, also one of the authors of the study published in a recent issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience, instructed participants to learn a difficult set of finger games, then divided the study _ into two groups: one that napped for an hour, and one that didn't. The people who took an afternoon snooze showed obvious improvement in their performance by that evening. "After a night's sleep the two groups were at the same level, but the group that slept in the afternoon improved much faster than the group that stayed awake," Karni said. And the study also showed just how much faster a 90-minute nap could help lock in long-term memories. "Daytime sleep can shorten the time 'how to' memory weakens and forgetting starts,"Karni said, "Instead of 6 to 8 hours, the brain consolidated the memory during the 90-minute nap."             question:             We can learn from the article that   _  .             options:             ['A. the new research has discovered the memory process during the sleep', 'B. taking a nap helps improve both long-term and short-term memories', "C. Karni's findings are based on comparisons between two groups of participants", 'D. people who take a nap will never forget "how to" skills once they are learned']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question, let's analyze the article step by step and compare it with the provided options:\n1. **Understanding the Research**: The article discusses a study by Avi Karni which suggests that naps may improve memory, particularly long-term memory consolidation. However, it clearly states that the exact mechanism of how memory systems work during sleep is still unknown.\n2. **Details of the Study**:\n   - Participants were asked to learn a difficult set of finger games.\n   - They were divided into two groups: one group took a nap for an hour, and the other did not nap.\n   - The group that napped showed significant improvement by the evening, which indicates that napping had a positive effect on memory performance.\n3. **Findings of the Study**: \n   - Both groups were at the same performance level after a full night's sleep.\n   - The napping group improved faster, indicating that napping aids faster memory consolidation.\n   - A 90-minute nap can enhance long-term memory retention significantly.\nNow, let's evaluate the provided options:\n- **Option A**: "the new research has discovered the memory process during the sleep" - This is incorrect. The article explicitly mentions that the exact process of how memory works during sleep is still unknown.\n The answer is **Option C**: "Karni's findings are based on comparisons between two groups of participants". 

- This option accurately reflects the methodology described in the article

Q: article:             Naps--short sleeps during the day--may improve memory, experts said recently.  New research conducted by brain researcher Avi Karni of the University of Haifa in Israel explores the possibility that naps help lock in sometimes long-term memories. "We still don't know exactly how memory system works during sleep, but the results of this research suggest it is possible to speed up memory consolidation ," Karni said. Long-term memory refers  to memories that stay with us for years, such as "what" memories -- a car accident that happened yesterday-- or "how to" memories, such as one's learned ability to play the pianos. Karni, also one of the authors of the study published in a recent issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience, instructed participants to learn a difficult set of finger games, then divided the study _ into two groups: one that napped for an hour, and one that didn't. The people who took an afternoon snooze showed obvious improvement in their performance by that evening. "After a night's sleep the two groups were at the same level, but the group that slept in the afternoon improved much faster than the group that stayed awake," Karni said. And the study also showed just how much faster a 90-minute nap could help lock in long-term memories. "Daytime sleep can shorten the time 'how to' memory weakens and forgetting starts,"Karni said, "Instead of 6 to 8 hours, the brain consolidated the memory during the 90-minute nap."             question:             The text is most probably taken from   _  .             options:             ['A. a newspaper report', 'B. a library guide', 'C. a project handbook', 'D. a science site']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine from where the text is most probably taken, we should consider the nature and style of the content.\n1. **Content Overview:** The text discusses scientific research about the effects of naps on memory, specifically referencing a study led by a brain researcher named Avi Karni from the University of Haifa. It mentions specific experimental results and their implications for memory consolidation.\n2. **Language and Style:** The language is straightforward and informative, discussing recent research findings and including quotes from the scientist involved. The information is detailed enough to suggest an audience interested in scientific findings but is presented in an accessible manner.\n3. **Options Analysis:**\n   - **A. a newspaper report:** Newspaper reports often cover recent studies or findings in a way that is accessible to the general public. The text's discussion of new research and its implications fits well with how newspapers report on scientific topics.\n   - **B. a library guide:** This option is unlikely because a library guide would typically focus on how to use library resources, and the content here is focused on research findings.\n   - **C. a project handbook:** A project handbook would contain guidelines or instructions for carrying out a specific project, which is quite different from discussing research findings.\n   - **D. a science site:** This option The answer is most likely as science sites often cover current scientific research and findings in a way that is detailed yet accessible. However, newspaper reports can also cover scientific studies in a

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided in the article:\n1. **Digital Age Influence**: The article discusses both positive and negative influences of the digital age on students. While tools like the Internet have made learning more engaging, there's an issue with distraction.\n2. **Distraction and Short Attention Spans**: According to the survey, technologies can distract students and lead to a generation with short attention spans (87% agreement).\n3. **Digital Literacy Issues**: Students often lack the skills to critically evaluate information they find online and tend to trust it too easily.\n4. **Ease of Finding Information**: A significant point made in the article is that being able to quickly find information online is leading to a diminished desire and ability to work hard to find answers.\n5. **Overdependence on Search Engines**: Teachers noted that students depend too much on search engines and do not make sufficient use of printed books or libraries.\n6. **Copying Work**: There's also a concern that the Internet makes it easier for students to copy work instead of being original.\nConsidering these points, the question asks why some students don't tend to work hard. The key point related to this is that students can find information quickly online, which leads them to be less The answer is A. they can get answers on the Internet quickly

Q: article:             Fifty people died, over 11,000 were injured, and 100,000 houses were heavily damaged or destroyed in an earthquake that struck North China's Hebei Province. The quake, measuring 6. 2 on the Richter scale (6 .2) , hit the area 220km northwest of Beijing at 11: 50 a. m. on January 10, 1998. Scientists made a report of the recent quake. They said that the area of northwestern Beijing, the joint of Shanxi and Hebei Provinces and the Inner Mongolia   were most easily attacked by earthquakes measuring 6 to a bit over 7 on the Richter scale. However, scientists did not see the recent earthquake earlier. Clouds covered a large area in the northern part of North China before the earthquake and experts say that this prevented satellites from correctly watching the temperature at the correct altitude  . Experts say that in the last ten years, about 305 earthquakes have taken place in China with 9 measuring over 7 on the Richter scale, 60 measuring over 6, and 236 measuring over 5. Tens of thousands of people died or were injured. Loss  valued over 10 billion yuan.             question:             When the earthquake attacked the area, most people there were unlikely to   _  .             options:             ['A. sleep in bed', 'B. work in the fields', 'C. walk in the streets', 'D. stay at home']
A: Let's think step by step.
To answer this question, we need to consider the time of day when the earthquake occurred and what people are likely to be doing at that time.\n1. **Time of the Earthquake**: The earthquake struck at 11:50 a.m. on January 10, 1998.\n   \n2. **Typical Activities at This Time**:\n   - **A. Sleep in bed**: It is late morning, so it is unlikely that most people would be sleeping at this time unless they have night shifts or other atypical schedules.\n   - **B. Work in the fields**: It's possible for people living in rural areas to work in the fields at this time.\n   - **C. Walk in the streets**: People might be walking in the streets during this time for various reasons like errands or commuting.\n   - **D. Stay at home**: Some people might be at home, but many would likely be out for work, school, or other activities during late morning.\n3. **Conclusion**: Given it is a late morning on a regular day, it is unlikely that most people would be "A. sleep in bed", as people are generally awake and engaged in daily activities by this time.\nTherefore, the most unlikely scenario for most people The answer is 'A. sleep in bed'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To answer the question correctly, we need to analyze what the given article reveals about the earthquake and its impact. \n1. **Understanding the Article**:\n   - The earthquake resulted in significant damage and casualties, with 50 people dead, over 11,000 injured, and 100,000 houses heavily damaged or destroyed.\n   - Scientists acknowledge they did not foresee this specific earthquake due to external factors (cloud coverage impeding satellite monitoring).\n2. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: "All the people stayed outside" might reduce casualties and injuries due to structural collapse but doesn’t directly address why the damages were severe.\n   - **Option B**: "The earthquake happened at midnight" likely would not reduce damages; typically, nighttime quakes may actually increase casualties as people are indoors and potentially asleep.\n   - **Option C**: "The people had been warned earlier" suggests that with prior warning, people could take preventive actions like evacuating buildings, leading to reduced casualties and injuries.\n   - **Option D**: "The earthquake scale was lower than 6.2 only" is a factual statement. A lower magnitude would naturally cause less damage, but it's not something that can be controlled or influenced.\n3. **Inference The answer is Option C: "The people had been warned earlier." 

With prior warning, measures could have been taken to evacuate or prepare residents, which likely would have

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which of the options is the least reasonable or possibly an exception, let's evaluate each statement based on the article's content and general understanding:\nA. "We cannot stop earthquakes."\n- This statement is reasonable. Earthquakes are natural phenomena that cannot be prevented by human intervention. The article also mentions that an earthquake occurred and caused significant damage, indicating the inevitability of such events.\nB. "Scientists are working hard at the researches on earthquakes."\n- This statement is reasonable. The article discusses scientists making reports and observations about the earthquakes, indicating ongoing research efforts to understand and predict them better.\nC. "We can do our best to have fewer damages than ever."\n- This statement is reasonable. While the article does not explicitly say that mitigation efforts are discussed, it's a logical conclusion that better understanding and preparedness can help reduce damage and casualties during earthquakes.\nD. "Nothing can be done on earthquakes."\n- This statement is not reasonable and is an exception. While earthquakes themselves cannot be prevented, steps can be taken to predict, prepare, and minimize damage, which contradicts the implication that nothing at all can be done regarding earthquakes.\nBased on this analysis, the least reasonable option, or the exception, is:\nD. "Nothing can be done on earthquakes." The answer is D. "Nothing can be done on earthquakes."

Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, the current paper and pencil look the same as they always did. Surely it can't be the same pencil? The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is definitely  the original one. "I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years." I say to her, walking back into the living-room with a sheet of paper and the pencil. "You still use a pencil. Can't you afford a pen?" My mother replies a little sharply. "It works perfectly  well. I've  always kept the stand in the kitchen. I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days." Immediately I can picture her, hair wild, blue housecoat covered in flour, a wooden spoon in one hand, the pencil in the other, her mouth moving silently. My mother smiles and says, "One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a brilliant thought, but the stand was empty. One of the children must have taken the paper.

A: Let's think step by step.
The author begins by reminiscing about a wooden stand for a notepad and pencil in the kitchen of her mother's houses. There is a sense of amazement at the longevity and consistency of the stand, as it has been present throughout various houses over forty years. The mention of the stand not having changed much implies an appreciation for its stability and continuity. The author expresses surprise that the stand has lasted so long, which suggests it's something notable to them. Additionally, the author describes a fond and vivid memory of her mother using the stand, further highlighting its sentimental significance. Therefore, the author's original opinion seems to be that the stand holds emotional and historical importance for the family, rather than a need for replacement or being passed down.\nHence, the author's original opinion about the wooden stand can be best captured by the option:\n'A. It has great value for the family.' The answer is A. It has great value for the family.

I've  always kept the stand in the kitchen. I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days." Immediately I can picture her, hair wild, blue housecoat covered in flour, a wooden spoon in one hand, the pencil in the other, her mouth moving silently. My mother smiles and says, "One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a brilliant thought, but the stand was empty. One of the children must have taken the paper. So I just picked up the breadboard and wrote it all down on the back. It turned out to be a real breakthrough for solving the mathematical problem I was working on." This story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how extraordinary my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician. I feel embarrassed that I complain about not having enough child-free time to work. Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards. Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics. Those symbols have travelled unaffected through fifty years, rooted in the soil of a cheap wooden breadboard, invisible   exhibits at every meal.             question:             The author feels embarrassed for  _  .             options:             ['A. blaming her mother wrongly', 'B. giving her mother a lot of trouble', 'C. not making good use of time as her mother did', 'D. not making any breakthrough in her field']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine why the author feels embarrassed, we need to analyze the story and the context in which the author reflects on their mother's past actions and their own situation.\n1. **Context**: The story focuses on the author's memory of their mother using a wooden stand with a notepad and pencil in the kitchen. The mother is depicted as a mathematician who would jot down ideas while cooking, indicating her ability to multitask and make use of available moments to work on her mathematical problems.\n2. **Mother's Example**: The author recalls how their mother, despite being busy with household duties and childcare, managed to have a breakthrough on a mathematical problem by using a breadboard to write her thoughts. This highlights the mother's creativity, efficiency, and ability to make the most of her time.\n3. **Author's Self-Reflection**: In contrast, the author reflects on their own situation. They mention feeling embarrassed about complaining about not having enough child-free time to work. This suggests that the author is drawing a comparison between their mother's effective use of time and their own perceived inability to do the same.\n4. **Embarrassment**: The author's embarrassment stems from this comparison. They feel that, unlike their mother who made good use of her time by integrating her work with The answer is C. not making good use of time as her mother did

Q: article:             In the kitchen of my mother's houses there has always been a wooden stand   with a small notepad   and a hole for a pencil. I'm looking for paper on which to note down the name of a book I am recommending to my mother. Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, the current paper and pencil look the same as they always did. Surely it can't be the same pencil? The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is definitely  the original one. "I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years." I say to her, walking back into the living-room with a sheet of paper and the pencil. "You still use a pencil. Can't you afford a pen?" My mother replies a little sharply. "It works perfectly  well.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine what the author thinks of her mother, we need to consider the key details and impressions shared in the text:\n1. **Recognition and Continuity**: The author describes a consistent memory of the kitchen setup involving the notepad and pencil stand, highlighting continuity over decades. This demonstrates respect for her mother's long-standing habits.\n2. **Author's Comments**: The author is amazed by the durability and continuity of the stand, which suggests admiration rather than finding her mother strange or careless.\n3. **Mother's Actions and Background**: The author recounts a story her mother told about writing a significant mathematical breakthrough on a breadboard when there was no paper around. This story emphasizes her mother’s dedication to her work and her ability to integrate it into daily life.\n4. **Reflection on Mother's Capabilities**: The author reflects on her mother being an extraordinary and gifted mathematician, acknowledging the significant achievements her mother accomplished despite the challenges she faced, like managing household tasks alongside her work.\n5. **Link to Options**:\n   - **A. Strange in behaviour**: There's no indication in the text that the author finds her mother's behavior strange. Instead, the story seems to evoke admiration.\n   - **B. Keen on her research**: This aligns well The answer is B. keen on her research

Q: article:             Alexander the Great was a mighty  king and conqueror . He was one of the greatest military geniuses  the world has ever known. He was born in Pella, Macedonia. Alexander grew to be a handsome, brilliant  man. Aristotle, the famous philosopher , came from Greece to teach him---geography, politics, literature, medicine and science. Alexander's father, King Philip II of Macedon, taught him to plan and win battles. The young prince became King when he was 20. He then began the series of marches that continued until he ruled almost all of the then-known world. On his great war horse, Bucephalus, he first took over Greece. He went on to conquer southeastern Europe, Asia Minor, Egypt and India. On his way he crushed  the Persian Empire, and was made King of Egypt and Asia. He and his troops traveled over 11,000 miles(17,700 km). He spread Greek customs and ideas wherever he went. In India his men refused to go further. They were tired and frightened, and wanted to go home. Worn out, Alexander agreed to turn back. He died of fever in Babylon, at the early age of 33.             question:             Alexander and his troops traveled and fought probably   _   then.             options:             ['A. by ship', 'B. by simple truck', 'C. on their horses', 'D. on foot']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how Alexander and his troops traveled and fought, let's consider the historical context and the information given in the article:\n1. **Historical Context**: Alexander the Great lived in the ancient world, specifically during the 4th century BCE. At that time, modern transportation methods like trucks did not exist.\n2. **Article Details**: The article mentions that Alexander conquered vast territories, including areas in Europe, Asia, and Egypt. It specifically highlights his great war horse, Bucephalus, and implies that horses were significant in his conquests.\n3. **Other Options Analysis**:\n   - **A. by ship**: While ships were used for certain military campaigns, especially across bodies of water, the article focuses on land campaigns where his war horse was mentioned.\n   - **B. by simple truck**: Trucks did not exist in Alexander's time.\n   - **C. on their horses**: The article emphasizes Alexander's use of his horse, Bucephalus, suggesting cavalry played a crucial role in his military strategies.\n   - **D. on foot**: Armies did travel on foot, but Alexander's leadership is notably associated with his cavalry tactics.\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is:\nC. on their horses The answer is 'C. on their horses'.

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine which statement is true, let's evaluate each option in light of the information provided in the article:\n- **Option A**: "He died in his late thirties."\n  - The article states that Alexander died at the age of 33, which is considered early thirties, not late thirties. Therefore, this statement is false.\n- **Option B**: "Bucephalus was probably a big ship."\n  - The article clearly mentions that Bucephalus was Alexander's great war horse, not a ship. Therefore, this statement is false.\n- **Option C**: "He conquered all the countries then known in the world."\n  - The article mentions that Alexander ruled almost all of the then-known world, but it does not claim he conquered all the countries. Therefore, this statement is exaggerated and can be considered false.\n- **Option D**: "Alexander was very ready to listen to anybody including his officers and soldiers."\n  - The article does not specifically mention Alexander's readiness to listen to others, but it does mention that his men refused to march further in India, indicating at least some level of consideration to their feelings.

Q: article:             We've all seen them: perfectly toned famous people on late-night television telling us that we too can develop rock-hard abdominal muscles . It's easy! Just pay $149.99 for the Torso Track or $149.75 for the Ad-Doer and watch those unwanted inches leave your waist. Americans spend tens of millions of dollars on various products to firm up their fat around the waist. And did they work? Not necessarily. Independent studies have concluded that most of these products -- no matter who approved them or how expensive they are -- shape your midsection no better than old-fashioned stomach crunches . Some can even cause injury -- like the $518.99 Body Shaper-Q8SP, which left electrical burns on some researchers at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse. Others, like the popular Ab-Doer, typically burn less energy than a gentle walk, according to a study to be published in September by the American Council on Exercise. The fact is that many Americans don't have the biological makeup to develop an obvious abdominal muscles. They are either unable to get the necessary muscle mass or they can't lose enough fat to make a difference. Even if the underlying muscles are well developed, all it takes to hide it is one-sixteenth of an inch of fat. That's enough to exclude most healthy women as well as plenty of guys who do crunches every day. So what works best? In its new study, the exercise experts researched on the results of the popular Ab-Doer. A lengthy TV advertisement promises that just 10 minutes a day performing such movements as "Body Boogies" and "Good Mornings" will "help form those muscles the fun and easy way without diets." Steven Loy, professor at California State University, Northridge, tested the promise by measuring the electrical activity produced by the abdominal muscles during three Ab-Doer movements. He and his colleagues then compared the results with those produced during traditional exercises. They determined that the muscles were no more active, and in some cases less so, when exercisers were using the Ab-Doer. Taking a broader approach, researchers at San Diego State University compared 13 abdominal exercises for their ability to develop the central abdominal muscles. They concluded, in a report published in May, that the most effective exercises kept turning the body and worked the muscles the entire time. Among the winners: the bicycle movements -- so called because it looks as if you are riding a bike while lying flat on the floor -- and exercises performed on the "Captain's Chair", a product typically found in gyms that helps hold the body in the air while you raise your legs up toward your chest. Researchers suggested that a varied routine of the different exercises could deliver the best results.             question:             Which of the following is the most effective in building abdominal muscles?             options:             ['A. Torso Track.', "B. Captain's Chair.", 'C. Ab-Doer.', 'D. Body Shaper-Q8SP.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the most effective method for building abdominal muscles based on the information provided in the article, we need to consider the findings of the studies mentioned.\n1. **Torso Track** and **Ab-Doer**: While these products are advertised as effective ways to develop abdominal muscles, the article suggests that they are no more effective than traditional exercises such as crunches. Moreover, the Ab-Doer was specifically tested by researchers, who found that it did not activate the abdominal muscles as much as traditional exercises.\n2. **Body Shaper-Q8SP**: This product not only failed to effectively shape the midsection but also caused injury, such as electrical burns, which makes it an unsafe option.\n3. **Captain's Chair**: The article mentions a study by researchers at San Diego State University that compared various abdominal exercises and found that those exercises that continuously engaged the muscles were more effective. The "Captain's Chair" was specifically listed as one of the most effective exercises.\nTherefore, given the findings of the San Diego State University study, the "Captain's Chair" (option B) is the most effective method mentioned for building abdominal muscles. \n**Answer: B. Captain's Chair.** The answer is B. Captain's Chair.

A: Let's think step by step.
The question seeks to determine the main reason why it's difficult for many Americans to achieve visible, firm abdominal muscles according to the article. Let's analyze the information provided:\n1. The passage suggests that, despite the existence of many products promising firm abdominal muscles, not all of them are effective, with many performing no better than traditional exercises. It also mentions that some can cause injuries, but this is presented as a specific downside of certain products, not the main reason why many struggle to get firm abs.\n2. One key point mentioned is the biological makeup of individuals. The text states: "The fact is that many Americans don't have the biological makeup to develop an obvious abdominal muscles." This implies some people's genetic predisposition determines how their bodies respond to exercise in terms of muscle toning.\n3. Additionally, it mentions the difficulty of losing enough fat to make a difference, noting that even a small amount of fat can hide well-developed muscles. \n4. Thus, the passage suggests that genetics and potentially having a slight amount of fat can prevent visible abs for many Americans, regardless of their efforts.\nNow let's look at the options:\n- Option A: "how big their muscles will be is determined by birth" aligns with the passage's mention of the biological makeup, indicating genetics play a The answer is A. how big their muscles will be is determined by birth

A: Let's think step by step.
To determine how the author convinces the readers, we should analyze the structure and content of the article.\n1. **Describing the situation**: The author begins by referencing the common appearance of toned famous individuals promoting fitness products on television, suggesting these products can help achieve similar results.\n2. **Introducing skepticism**: The article introduces skepticism by mentioning that despite Americans spending large amounts on such products, they don't necessarily work better than traditional exercises.\n3. **Citing studies**: The article references independent studies to support the claim that these products are no more effective than traditional crunches. Specific examples are given:\n   - The Body Shaper-Q8SP caused injuries like electrical burns, according to researchers at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse.\n   - The Ab-Doer was found to burn less energy than a gentle walk according to a study by the American Council on Exercise.\n   - A study from San Diego State University compared 13 abdominal exercises and identified the most effective ones, like bicycle movements and exercises on the "Captain's Chair".\n4. **Explaining scientific reasons**: The article explains that some people may not be biologically able to develop obvious abdominal muscles due to difficulty in gaining muscle mass or losing fat to make a visible difference.\n5. The answer is 'B. presenting findings of researches'. The author uses research findings and studies to support the claims made in the article, making this the most convincing method used to

Q: article:             The Maldives faces the threat of extinction from rising sea levels, but the government said on Thursday it was looking to the future with plans to build homes and a golf course that float. An increase in sea levels of just 18 to 59 centimeters would make the Maldives -- a nation of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean -- virtually uninhabitable by 2100, the UN's climate change panel has warned. President Mohamed Nasheed has vowed a fight for survival, and last month he signed a deal with a Dutch company to study proposals for a floating structure that could support a convention centre, homes and an 18-hole golf course. "It is still early stages and we are awaiting a report on the possibility," a government official said. The company, Dutch Docklands, is currently building floating developments in the Netherlands and Dubai. There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make "land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land". The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change. Nasheed, who staged the world's first underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight his people's dilemma , has even spoken of buying land elsewhere in the world to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. He has also pledged the Hulhumale to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming "carbon neutral" by 2020. His plan involves ending fossil fuel use and powering all vehicles and buildings from "green" sources.             question:             What's the main idea of the passage?             options:             ['A. The Maldives plans to build floating homes for the rising sea level.', "B. The Maldives's president signed a deal with a Dutch company.", 'C. The Maldives staged the first underwater cabinet meeting.', 'D. The Maldives is considering ways to fight against the global warming.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the main idea of the passage, we need to analyze the provided information carefully:\n1. The passage discusses the threat of extinction that the Maldives faces due to rising sea levels and mentions its government's plans to address this issue. This involves contemplating the construction of floating homes and infrastructure.\n2. The Maldives' president, Mohamed Nasheed, is actively planning for the country's future by exploring various strategies to combat the impact of climate change, including the potential signing of a deal with a Dutch company to create floating structures.\n3. The passage also mentions other efforts by Nasheed, such as staging an underwater cabinet meeting to draw attention to the Maldives' climate change dilemma and discussing relocation options for inhabitants if necessary.\n4. Furthermore, there is a goal mentioned to achieve "carbon neutrality" by 2020 by shifting away from fossil fuels and adopting "green" energy sources.\nLooking at the options:\n- Option A: "The Maldives plans to build floating homes for the rising sea level." - This captures an important detail related to the struggle against rising sea levels, but it doesn't encompass the broader theme of the passage concerning multiple strategies being considered to combat climate change.\n- Option B: "The Maldives's president signed a deal with a Dutch company." - This focuses on a specific detail The answer is D. The Maldives is considering ways to fight against the global warming.

This option encompasses the broader theme of the passage, which is the various strategies the Maldives is

The Hulhumale is a natural island near the capital of Male.', 'B. The Hulhumale is an artificial island to be built near the capital.', 'C. The Hulhumale was built in 1997 and has settled over 30,000 people.', 'D. The Hulhumale is protected by a 30-million-dollar sea wall.']
A: Let's think step by step.
To determine the correct statement about the Hulhumale, let's carefully analyze the information provided in the article:\n1. The article mentions that "The Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there."\n2. From this information, we can deduce:\n   - Hulhumale is an artificial island (not a natural one).\n   - The construction of Hulhumale began in 1997.\n   - Over 30,000 people have been settled on this island.\nNow, let's review the options:\n- **Option A**: "The Hulhumale is a natural island near the capital of Male."  \n  - This is incorrect because Hulhumale is an artificial island, not a natural one.\n- **Option B**: "The Hulhumale is an artificial island to be built near the capital."  \n  - This is incorrect because the construction began in 1997, so it has already been built and populated.\n- **Option C**: "The Hulhumale was built in 1997 and has settled over 30,000 people."  \n  - This is correct based on the information provided in the article The answer is Option C: "The Hulhumale was built in 1997 and has settled over 30,000 people."
